In this study, bacterial salt stress tolerance screening and the possible changes in its secretome under two levels of NaCl stress was evaluated. The salt tolerance screening suggested that the bacterium is able to grow and survive in up to 900 mM NaCl. Thuricin17 production at salt levels from 100 to 500 mM NaCl was quantified using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Salt stress adversely affected the production of Th17 at levels as low as 100 mM NaCl; and the production stopped at 500 mM NaCl, despite the bacterium thriving at these salt levels. Hence, a comparative proteomic study was conducted on the supernatant of the bacterium after 42 h of growth, when Th17 production peaked in the control culture, as determined by Liquid Chromatography - Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Optimal (salt free) bacterial culture served as a control and 200 and 500 mM NaCl as stress conditions. As salt levels increased, the major enzyme classes, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, and ligases showed increased abundance as compared to the control, mostly related to molecular function mechanisms. Some of the notable up-regulated proteins in 500 mM NaCl stress conditions included an S-layer protein, chitin binding domain 3 protein, enterotoxins, phosphopentomutase, glucose 6-phosphate isomerase and bacterial translation initiation factor; while notable down-regulated proteins included hemolytic enterotoxin, phospholipase, sphingomyelinase C, cold shock DNA-binding protein family and alcohol dehydrogenase. These results indicate that, as the salt stress levels increase, the bacterium probably shuts down the production of Th17 and regulates its molecular functional mechanisms to overcome stress. This study indicates that end users have the option of using Th17 as a biostimulant or the live bacterial inoculum depending on the soil salt characteristics, for crop production.

Collective Sensemaking for the Responsible Use of Sensor Data at Work}, container_title={}, abstract={People are increasingly subject to the tracking of data about them at their workplaces. Sensor tracking is used by organizations to generate data on the movement and interaction of their employees to monitor and manage workers, and yet this data also poses significant risks to individual employees who may face harms from such data, and from data errors, to their job security or pay as a result of such analyses. Working with a large hospital, we developed a set of intervention strategies to enable what we call \"collective sensemaking\" describing worker contestation of sensor tracking data. We did this by participating in the sensor data science team, analyzing data on badges that employees wore over a two-week period, and then bringing the results back to the employees through a series of participatory workshops. We found three key aspects of collective sensemaking important for understanding data from the perspectives of stakeholders: 1) data shadows for tempering possibilities for design with the realities of data tracking; 2) data transducers for converting our assumptions about sensor tracking, and 3) data power for eliciting worker inclusivity and participation. We argue that researchers face what Dourish (2019) called the \"legitimacy trap\" when designing with large datasets and that research about work should commit to complementing data-driven studies with in-depth insights to make them useful for all stakeholders as a corrective to the underlying power imbalance that tracked workers face.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

measurements caused by the multiplet splitting from the earth's lateral heterogeneity. We apply our probabilistic results to a data set of unstacked Q\u22121 measurements for fundamental spheroidal modes from 0S13 through 0S28. Multiplet broadening of only 14 \u00d7 10\u22124 of the central frequency is sufficient to account for the scatter of the observed data. The observed scatter of Q\u22121 data is caused by a combination of three effects: lateral heterogeneity of density and velocities, actual lateral heterogeneity of Q\u22121 in the earth, and measurement error. The last two effects can only reduce the amount of lateral heterogeneity of density and velocities which is required to produce the observed scatter. Thus, by attributing the entire multiplet broadening to lateral heterogeneity of elastic properties, we can obtain an upper bound on its effect.

fires or hot spots are all-inclusive issues in coal mines everywhere throughout the globe. Aimless mining over a period of past 100 years has prompted large scale damages to the ecosystem of the earth. For example, debasement in nature of water, soil, air, vegetation dissemination and variations in land topography have caused degradation. Research is needed to be more attentive on developing the prospective use of the satellite image analysis for hot spot detection because ground-based hot spots monitoring is time-taking, complex, cumbrous and very expensive. In this paper, a two-stage model has been developed to extract the hot spot delineated boundaries in Jharia coal field (JCF) region. In the first stage, contextual thresholding (CT) technique has been used to classify the hot spot and non-hot spot regions. After thorough processing, hot spots regions have been retrieved and for performance evaluation sensitivity and specificity are calculated, which suggest that hot spots were detected accurately in successful and efficient way. In second stage, the Canny edge detection algorithm is applied to detect the edges of the hot spot regions and then the binary image is generated, which is later converted into a vector image. Finally Hough transform is implemented on the obtained vector images for delineating hot spot boundaries. In future, delineated hot spot boundaries may be used to obtain the expansion or shrinking information of hot spot regions and it can be used for area estimation also.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Organic Chemistry\", \"Drug Discovery\", \"Pharmacology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [82, 0, 0], "string": "title={Modified carbazoles destabilize microtubules and kill glioblastoma multiform cells}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Infectious Diseases\", \"Insect Science\", \"Parasitology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [74, 0, 0], "string": "title={Forensic entomology cases in Thailand: a review of cases from 2000 to 2006}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology\", \"Civil and Structural Engineering\"]", "language": "en", "length": [90, 0, 1445], "string": "title={Probabilistic assessment of reinforced soil wall performance using response surface method}, container_title={}, abstract={The paper demonstrates the use of the response surface method (RSM) to carry out probabilistic assessment of selected performance features of geosynthetic-reinforced segmental retaining walls under operational conditions. The method substantially reduces the number of Monte Carlo simulations required to carry out probabilistic analysis of numerical models with a large number of problem parameters. A numerical model is verified using performance data from three physical full-scale laboratory walls, and is then used to generate a large synthetic database of numerical results for maximum wall facing deformation, maximum reinforcement connection strains and maximum reinforcement strains in the backfill. Closed-form solutions (performance functions) are formulated using a full quadratic polynomial, which is a common feature of the RSM. The coefficient values of the closed-form solutions are found using a least squares method to give good agreement between the RSM equations and numerical results. The RSM equations for each performance function are used to carry out Monte Carlo simulations and the results presented as cumulative distribution functions. The resulting cumulative distribution functions can be used for quantitative reliability-based assessment of wall facing deformations and reinforcement strains under operational conditions for walls

The four nuclei produced by female meiosis associate together in a polar body-like structure, while a bipolar spindle is established around the metaphase-arrested male pronucleus. Thus, the major defect caused by depletion of the KLP3A protein is either in specification of the female pronucleus, or in migration of the male and female pronuclei toward each other. We have also found that the KLP3A protein is located throughout the metaphase spindle during meiosis and the early embryonic mitotic divisions, but later accu-mulates specifically at the midzone of these same spindles during telophase. The protein is also present on two other microtubule structures: the sperm aster; and the radial, monastral array of microtubules established between the two meiosis II spindles. We discuss these results in light of possible functions of the KLP3A protein in pronuclear specification and migration.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Professional use of Twitter is ideal for physicians interested in both networking and education and is optimally used to facilitate in-person networking. Live-tweeting (posting real-time reactions to events) at professional meetings is also a popular and highly successful use of Twitter. Physicians report patient privacy as the top concern preventing use of social media for professional reasons, and although generally social media use is safe, it is essential to understand how to protect patient confidentially. Other social media platforms with potential for professional use include Facebook (Facebook, Inc, Menlo Park, California), Instagram (Facebook, Inc), YouTube (YouTube, LLC, San Bruno, California), and Periscope (Twitter, Inc).

resumen de las Intervenciones Humanitarias para la Recuperaci\u00f3n del Trauma con Terapia de Reprocesamiento y Desensibilizaci\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s del Movimiento Ocular (EMDR) en Latinoam\u00e9rica y el Caribe y proporciona al lector ejemplos de historias cl\u00ednicas obtenidas en la primera l\u00ednea de apoyo. A lo largo de los muchos a\u00f1os realizando trabajo de campo, hemos observado que el trauma psicol\u00f3gico, como consecuencia de las situaciones multifac\u00e9ticas que enfrentan los individuos y comunidades despu\u00e9s de un desastre, implica un gran reto. En el presente art\u00edculo, describimos las Intervenciones Humanitarias con Terapia EMDR realizadas desde 1998 en Latinoam\u00e9rica y el Caribe, para tratar las perturbaciones psicol\u00f3gicas que se presentan en las y los sobrevivientes despu\u00e9s de desastres naturales (ej. inundaciones, deslizamientos de tierra, terremotos), desastres provocados por el hombre, masacres humanas y violencia interpersonal severa. Se ha proporcionado tratamiento a ni\u00f1os, adolescentes y adultos sobrevivientes, frecuentemente en las comunidades donde ocurrieron los desastres; as\u00ed como a auxiliadores y a pacientes con c\u00e1ncer. Los protocolos de Intervenci\u00f3n Temprana con Terapia EMDR son intervenciones breves y efectivas que pueden ser utilizadas en campo o en situaciones de emergencia. Existe un cuerpo de investigaciones que apoyan el uso de protocolos modificados de Terapia EMDR para tratar el trauma agudo en formatos de atenci\u00f3n individual y grupal (Jarero, Artigas, & Luber, 2011).}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Genetics\", \"Animal Science and Zoology\", \"Food Science\"]", "language": "en", "length": [61, 0, 0], "string": "title={Cow Type and the Nutritional Environment: Nutritional Aspects}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Surgery\", \"Surgery\"]", "language": "de", "length": [65, 32, 0], "string": "title={16.

Medicare gives the population \u201creasonable\u201d access\u201d to all \u201cmedically necessary\u201d physician and hospital services, long-term care is not formally subject to those conditions. In Ontario, long-term care involves a \u201cpatchwork quilt\u201d of government, charitable, for-profit, and personally-provided services; an ongoing consultation has been under way in an attempt to rationalize service financing and provision. This paper reviews the series of policy proposals and the accompanying public consultation processes. It concludes that the emphasis on \u201ccommunity involvement\u201d without a clear definition of \u201ccommunity\u201d or the goals of participation has paradoxically increased the \u201cscope of

These calculations allow verifying basic estimations and assumptions, proposing improvements, and computing quantities that are not easy to calculate with an analytical approach. For instance, the estimation of losses in HTS is fundamental during the design stage since losses can strongly influence the cooling system requirements and operating temperature. Typically, 2D finite element analysis is used to calculate AC losses in HTS, due to the lack of analytical solutions that can accurately represent complex operating conditions, such as AC transport current and AC external applied magnetic field in coils. These 2D models are usually a representation of an infinitely long arrangement. Therefore, they cannot be used to analyze end effects and complex 3D configurations. In this publication, we use the homogenization of the T-A formulation in 3D for the analysis of superconducting coils with complex geometries where a 2D approach cannot provide accurate analyses and verification of assumptions. The modeling methodology allows an easier implementation in commercial software (COMSOL Multiphysics) in comparison with the currently available 3D H homogenization, despite the complexity of the geometry. This methodology is first validated with a racetrack coil (benchmark case) by comparing the results with the well-established H formulation. Then, the electromagnetic behavior of coils with more complex geometries is analyzed.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Space and Planetary Science\", \"Astronomy and Astrophysics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [47, 30, 0], "string": "title={Molecular collisions in the interstellar medium}, container_title={Astrophysics and Space Science}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Management of Technology and Innovation\", \"Political Science and International Relations\", \"Sociology and Political Science\", \"Media Technology\", \"Communication\"]", "language": "lt", "length": [69, 0, 2844], "string": "title={Realyb\u0117s stilistika televizijoje: visuomen\u0117s transformacij\u0173 atspindys}, container_title={}, abstract={Realyb\u0117s televizijos stilistika demonstravo kintant\u012f televizijos po\u017ei\u016br\u012f \u012f eilin\u012f piliet\u012f.

On screen, a professional (expert, politician, artist) started to be replaced by the everyman who was telling his own life story; the approach of different layers of the public was declared. The viewer became a co-author of TV programs, the public was involved in programs that tackled crucial issues, and television started to imitate functions of governmental or public institutions. Hybrid reality genres offered fact-based stories with the participation of real characters. The boundary between documentary and entertainment genres began to vanish. At the end of the past century, there emerged a new variety of reality shows (close space, total imitation, try-out, survival) which revealed cardinal changes of the public\u2019s attitude towards privacy. Through playing its roles of a psychologist, conciliator or that of the last instance, television tries to compensate the lack of relationship among members of the public and to re-establish a broken dialogue between individuals and groups. The stylistics of reality in the present paper is analysed in the light of three aspects: change of dialogue genres, informal institutionalism, and reflection of the public\u2019s changes in new formats of reality shows.

Device activation is typically ~4 weeks after the implant procedure. Report of Case A 61yo male with severe OSA had an upper airway stimulation device placed by ENT. At that time, stimulation produced bilateral tongue protrusion. In the immediate post-operative period, after closure, a hematoma, at the inferior chest incision, was discovered and drained with cauterization of the bleeding vessel. Seven weeks after implant, patient reported to our sleep clinic for activation of the device; and at that time, there was no sensation or activation up to the maximum amplitude of 5mV. The device reported an acceptable respiratory waveform, and triggering on and off sets but without sensory outcomes. Changing of the electrode configuration with advanced settings had no effect. Impedance values were acceptable. Tongue movements were grossly intact. At 2 months, ENT evaluation found mild hypoglossal nerve neuropraxia. To assess for a device related issue, x-rays of the neck and chest were performed and showed proper placement of the device. At 3.5 months, neuropraxia had resolved but device activation was unsuccessful, with no sensory or motor activation to 5mV stimulation. Plans were made for a procedure during which the lead electrode or implantable pulse generator would be assessed or replaced. At 4 months after implantation, in a multidisciplinary appointment with Sleep, ENT and the device representative, with a 3 electrode negative pole and the generator as the + pole, at 2.3mV, the device was activated. At the present time, the patient is exploring higher and lower mV settings and a PSG titration is scheduled. Conclusion This is the longest recorded duration (3.5+ months) of unsuccessful post-operative activation; and it occurred ~2 months after clinical signs of hypoglossal nerve neuropraxia had resolved.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

may result in endothelial dysfunction. Because hypothermia attenuates many inflammatory processes, the authors hypothesized that hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass would be associated with better endothelial function than normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. Methods Isoflurane-anesthetized New Zealand White rabbits were randomized to undergo 90 min of either normothermic (37 degrees C, n=9) or hypothermic (27 degrees C, n=9) cardiopulmonary bypass with terminal rewarming. A third group served as anesthetized normothermic non-cardiopulmonary bypass surgical controls (n=8). Basilar artery and descending thoracic aorta were isolated from each animal. In vitro vessel relaxation responses to increasing concentrations of acetylcholine (which induces endothelial release of nitric oxide) and nitroprusside (which provides exogenous nitric oxide) were measured in phenylephrine-precontracted vessel rings. Results There were no differences in vessel relaxation responses between normothermic and hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass groups in basilar artery or aorta. In contrast, basilar arteries from non-cardiopulmonary bypass controls had increased relaxation responses to both acetylcholine (P=0.004) and nitroprusside (P=0.031) compared with the pooled cardiopulmonary bypass animal data. Conclusions The authors observed no differences in endothelial or vascular smooth muscle function between normothermic and hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass groups. Compared with non-cardiopulmonary bypass controls, cardiopulmonary bypass appeared to decrease basilar artery smooth muscle relaxation in response to endogenous and exogenous nitric oxide.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Rehabilitation\", \"Health (social science)\"]", "language": "en", "length": [88, 0, 0], "string": "title={Reprise: Case Management in Substance Use Services in the Age of the Affordable Care Act}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Materials Chemistry\", \"Metals and Alloys\", \"Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering\"]", "language": "en", "length": [123, 0, 0], "string": "title={Copper chloride leaching from chalcopyrite and bornite concentrates containing high levels of impurities and minor elements}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)\", \"Anthropology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [52, 23, 0], "string": "title={Translating Maya Hieroglyphs by Scott A.

In this paper, a fuzzy-based mechanism is presented for automatic personalized assessment in an e-learning system for computer programming. Particularly, the selection of the most appropriate test items for each individual student is based on a variety of criteria: (i) the student\u2019s knowledge level, (ii) the student\u2019s prior knowledge of computer programming, (iii) the type of programming errors that the student is prone to make, and (iv) the difficulty level of the test items. Linguistic values are used to determine these criteria. Additionally, 45 fuzzy rules are used over these criteria, which imitate the way of thinking of human tutors with regard to deciding about the most appropriate test items that have to be included in an adaptive test. The presented mechanism was used under real conditions and evaluated by experts and students of the Department of Informatics of the University of Piraeus, Greece with very encouraging results.

ABSTRACT: Geochemistry environment of the River of the Stones sub-basin, Diamantina, MG.The soils, stream sediments and surface water are considered as component of the natural geochemical systeminside the hydrographic basin and, therefore, with the geochemistry characterization it is possible to effectan evaluation of the environment chemical quality of the sub-basin of River of the Stones. The draining netof this sub-basin has as bedrock sequences of Supergroup Espinha\u00e7o, rocks of Supergroup Para\u00fana River,beyond associating intrusive igneous rocks. The geomorphology context includes events of deposition anddenudation of the uplands, however preserved in the top of the watersheds. This sub-basin was selected forstudies due to its characteristics of urban occupation and for the fact of getting into a unit of conservation. Theregional geochemical data had been used as comparative base for the results of the analyses in the sub-basin.The physical-chemical analyses of soils, stream sediment and water had been carried through in periods ofdry and rainy seasons. The results had been dealt statistically and compared with values standards definedfor the environmental legislation.

There is no satisfactory systemic treatment for Castleman\u2019s disease. CNTO 328 is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds with both high specificity and high affinity while neutralizing the biological activity of human IL-6. In an ongoing phase 1 study of CNTO 328, 22 patients with Castleman\u2019s disease (9 newly diagnosed) were treated according to the following schedule: 3 mg/kg q 2 weeks (n= 1), 6 mg/kg q 2 weeks (n=2), 12 mg/kg q 2 weeks (n=3), 9 mg/kg q 3 weeks (n=5), 12 mg/kg q 3 weeks (n=8), or 6 mg/kg weekly (n=3). Disease types included hyaline vascular (9), plasmacytic (11), mixed (1) and undetermined (1). No patients are known to be either HIV+ or HHV\u22128+. The average number of infusions received was 23 with median drug exposure of 295 days (up to 1015 days). CNTO 328 was well tolerated with 10 patients (45%) having no drug-related toxicity greater than grade 1 and three patients (14%) with drug-related toxicity of grade 3 or higher (anemia, vomiting, herpes zoster). The most common drug related side effects, seen in more than 10% of patients were elevated ALT, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia and upper respiratory tract infection. There were no deaths attributed to CNTO 328. Most patients (18/22 or 82%) experienced clinical benefit response, defined as improvement in at least one of the 6 measures (hemoglobin, fatigue, anorexia, fever/night sweats, weight, or size of largest lymph node) with all other measures stable or better on at least one assessment. Additional evidence of clinical benefit included increased hemoglobin [median maximum increase of 2.15 g/dL (range: 0.3\u20137.2 g/dL)]. A high frequency of tumor response (both complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]) as per modified International Working Group criteria was confirmed by independent radiological review. Seven of 11 evaluable patients [64%, 95% CI (31%, 89%)] treated with 12mg/kg on either the q 2 week or q 3 week schedule responded (1 CR, 5 PR, 1 unconfirmed PR), with time to initial response ranging from 9 to 36 weeks. No radiologic response was seen at doses lower than 12mg/kg. All 6 patients who required steroids at study entry were able to discontinue steroid use. Complete suppression of CRP (a surrogate for IL-6 activity) on at least one follow up assessment was observed in 83% of patients with post-baseline CRP values (median baseline level of 13.6 mg/L (range 1-260 mg/L). These interim results appear to demonstrate substantial benefit of CNTO 328 in Castleman\u2019s disease, which merits further investigation.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

The endings of the motor nerves in striped muscle remain on the outside of the sarcolemma. Aside from the surfaces of contact of muscle and nerve fibre, the end fibres are covered down to their tips with the sheath of Schwann and are provided with nuclei. The precise condition of things at the places of contact of muscle and nerve is an unsolved problem of histology. 2. The ivy-like or festooned arrangement of motor nerves in the frog's muscle has been misinterpreted. Properly interpreted it demonstrates that the nerve fibres that are to influence the muscle fibre are not naked and that they need not be end fibres. It shows that mere contact between muscle fibre and nerve fibre is all that is necessary. 3. The sheath of Henle in the frog and in the smaller muscle fibres of the snake is open, thus permitting escape of the cerebrospinal fluid. 4. In other animals Henle's sheath extends over the end fibres of the motor nerve and the cells lining it envelop the end fibrils. I find that the so-called \"Sohlensubstanz\" of Ku\u0308hne is derived from the cells of Henle's sheath. 5. The terminal nerves in smooth muscle form a network entwining the bundles of muscle fibres. I consider it improbable that each plain muscle fibre has a special terminal nerve fibril. 6. In muscular tissue fine non-medullated nerves, probably belonging to the centrifugal, vasomotor system, proceed from the fasciculi of motor nerves. These nerves can be traced directly to a network of nerves surrounding the capillaries. From this network fine, nucleated, nerve fibres pass to the walls of the capillaries, with which they are very closely united. 7. The nerves supplying the capillaries connect also with sensory nerves and with nerves surrounding the larger blood-vessels, both arteries and veins. 8. The branches of the chorda tympani in the submaxillary gland do not pass to the gland cells, but they terminate on the capillaries. 9. In muscular and glandular tissues\u2014and perhaps throughout the body\u2014there is a vast peripheral nervous plexus belonging to the capillary blood-vessels. These nerves of the capillaries, which may perhaps be regarded as nutritive nerves, regulate the production and transudation of lymph, and are concerned in the mechanism of glandular secretion. They may be called into activity both by peripheral influences and by impulses received from the central nervous system and the sympathetic ganglia. They may influence, through their connections with the vasomotor nerves on the arteries and veins, the blood supply to a part.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Publications appearing in PubMed, Scopus, and ISI\u2013Web of Knowledge database were selected using Medical Subject Headings key terms. Overall, published data confirmed that vaccination with attenuated live vaccines during therapy with immunomodulatory/immunosuppressive therapies should be avoided. For nonlive vaccines, a more favorable safety profile of biologic agents compared to conventional systemic agents is described as the humoral response to vaccines is in general well-preserved. Treatment with cyclosporine and methotrexate is associated with lower antibody titers to vaccines, and thus these agents are better discontinued during vaccination.

Explicit Estimation of Clay and Organic Carbon Content in Agricultural Soils Using Multi-Annual Imaging Spectroscopy Data}, container_title={Applied and Environmental Soil Science}, abstract={Information on soil clay and organic carbon content on a regional to local scale is vital for a multitude of reasons such as soil conservation, precision agriculture, and possibly also in the context of global environmental change. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of multi-annual hyperspectral images acquired with the HyMap sensor (450\u20132480 nm) during three flight campaigns in 2004, 2005, and 2008 for the prediction of clay and organic carbon content on croplands by means of partial least squares regression (PLSR). Supplementary, laboratory reflectance measurements were acquired under standardized conditions. Laboratory spectroscopy yielded prediction errors between 19.48 and 35.55 g kg\u22121for clay and 1.92 and 2.46 g kg\u22121for organic carbon. Estimation errors with HyMap image spectra ranged from 15.99 to 23.39 g kg\u22121for clay and 1.61 to 2.13 g kg\u22121for organic carbon. A comparison of parameter predictions from different years confirmed the predictive ability of the models. BRDF effects increased model errors in the overlap of neighboring flight strips up to 3 times, but an appropriated preprocessing method can mitigate these negative influences. Using multi-annual image data, soil parameter maps could be successively complemented. They are exemplarily shown providing field specific information on prediction accuracy and image data source.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

As insurance coverage has been closely related to household welfare, we aim to investigate the influence of air pollution, in particular, the sulfur dioxide (SO2) pollution on household purchases of commercial health insurance using data from the 2017 China Household Financial Survey (CHFS). The results show that the rise in SO2 emission has a significant positive association with tendency of residents to participate in commercial health insurance. The possibility of household commercial health insurance purchasing increases by 4% per 1,000 tons of SO2 emission. In addition, the proportion of commercial health insurance expenditure in household annual income increases by 29% per 1,000 tons of SO2 emission. The effects are also found to differ among resident groups. Residents in eastern parts of China are more likely to buy commercial health insurance facing SO2 pollution compared to those in western parts of China; people with higher income are more likely to be affected compared to those with lower income; families with the household head being female are more likely to be affected compared to those with the household head being male.

the aquatic food web of a tropical lowland stream}, container_title={}, abstract={In-stream ecosystem processes in a tropical lowland stream in far north Queensland were studied by measuring open-system community metabolism and analysing stable isotopes. The stream catchment, like many others in this region, has been extensively cleared for the cultivation of sugar cane, and in the absence of riparian shading, aquatic and semi-aquatic plants choke the stream channel. Stream community metabolism switched between autotrophy and heterotrophy, depending on the degree of cloud cover. Successive cloudy days may be sufficient to result in anoxia in the stream, particularly in the benthos, where limited oxygen penetration into the sediments was recorded. Stable-isotope data indicated that little of the primary production from sugar cane or other C4 plants was transferred into the aquatic food web. The only significant contribution of C4 carbon was to the diets of some larger predatory fish, which must be directly dependent on terrestrial prey. In the absence of significant riparian inputs of C3 carbon, it appears that in-stream primary production supported the aquatic invertebrate community. Restoration of disturbed stream systems such as this one must include the establishment of appropriate riparian species for the reduction of excessive in-stream primary production and the supply of detritus for the maintenance of aquatic food webs.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience\", \"Molecular Biology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [183, 0, 0], "string": "title={Ferulic Acid Improves Functional Recovery after Acute Spinal Cord Injury in Rats by Inducing Hypoxia to Inhibit microRNA-590 and Elevate Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Expressions}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Energy Engineering and Power Technology\", \"Fuel Technology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [30, 39, 0], "string": "title={Aneurism of the Thoracic Aorta}, container_title={The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Acoustics and Ultrasonics\", \"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)\"]", "language": "en", "length": [70, 0, 1252], "string": "title={Loudness effect on pitch and timbre discrimination; a continuing study}, container_title={}, abstract={Fine discrimination in pitch and timbre is a requisite skill for musicians and audio professionals.

Techniques for Phenol Oxidases in Solution}, container_title={Catalysts}, abstract={Over the past two decades, phenol oxidases, particularly laccases and tyrosinases, have been extensively used for the removal of numerous pollutants in wastewaters due to their broad substrate specificity and their ability to use readily accessible molecular oxygen as the essential cofactor. As for other enzymes, immobilisation of laccases and tyrosinases has been shown to improve the performance and efficiency of the biocatalysts in solution. Several reviews have addressed the enzyme immobilisation techniques and the application of phenol oxidases to decontaminate wastewaters. This paper offers an overview of the recent publications, mainly from 2012 onwards, on the various immobilisation techniques applied to laccases and tyrosinases to induce and/or increase the performance of the biocatalysts. In this paper, the emphasis is on the efficiencies achieved, in terms of structural modifications, stability and resistance to extreme conditions (pH, temperature, inhibitors, etc.), reactivity, reusability, and broad substrate specificity, particularly for application in bioremediation processes. The advantages and disadvantages of several enzyme immobilisation techniques are also discussed. The relevance and effectiveness of the immobilisation techniques with respect to wastewater decontamination are critically assessed. A perspective on the future directions for large-scale application of the phenol oxidases in immobilised forms is provided.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

To determine if group well child care (GWCC) for high-risk children affects maternal-child interaction and development as compared to these outcomes in children receiving traditional individual well child care (IWCC). Study Design. Randomized controlled trial. Participants. Infants less than 4 months old at the initiation of the study who came from high-risk families. Families were classified as high risk, and eligible for study participation, if the mother had one or more of the following characteristics: poverty, single marital status, less than a high school education, age less than 20 years at delivery, previous substance abuse, or a history of abuse as a child. Setting. Two urban, university pediatric clinics in Seattle, Washington. Interventions. Study children were randomized to receive GWCC or IWCC prior to the first study visit at the age of 4 months. Study health supervision visits were scheduled at 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 15 months of age. For children randomized to receive GWCC, study visits consisted of an age-matched group discussion of child rearing issues, either preceding or following a brief physical examination. After the 15-month visit, development of study patients was assessed by the use of Bayley Scales of Infant Development (Bayley). Maternal-child interaction and the home environment were evaluated by the use of the Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scale (NCATS) and the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME), respectively. Results. At least one outcome measure was obtained on 114 children; 86 patients completed all three outcome measures. Bayley psychomotor mean scores were 103.6 \u00b1 11.5 for GWCC patients versus 100.0 \u00b1 12.4 for those receiving IWCC (P= .14); mean scores for the mental section were 99.3 \u00b1 14.8 and 100.4 \u00b1 14.3, respectively (P = .71). The prevalence of high-risk maternal-child interactions was 10% in both the GWCC and IWCC groups. A high-risk home environment was found in 16% of IWCC patients versus 4% of those randomized to GWCC (odds ratio comparing IWCC to GWCC 4.6, 95% confidence interval 0.78, 26.0, after controlling for confounding variables). Provider time was similar among groups (mean number of minutes/patient/study visit: 19.8 \u00b1 5.6 and 20.4 \u00b1 6.7 for GWCC and IWCC, respectively,P = .66). Conclusion. GWCC is a viable alternative to IWCC for high-risk children. Developmental outcomes and maternal-child interaction are at least as good for children who received GWCC as compared to traditional IWCC, without any increase in provider time required. well child

This study aimed to investigate the absorption process of four kinds of complexing iron absorbed by Anabaena flos-aquae. Results showed that the absorptive capacity of A. flos-aquae to complex iron was inversely proportional to the stability of the complex bond of complex iron. Complex iron with weak binding ability can be quickly adsorbed by A. flos-aquae. The absorptive rate was as follows: ferric humate, ferric oxalate >ammonium ferric citrate >EDTA Fe. For EDTA-Fe with a strong binding ability, a moderate iron concentration (e.g. 0.6 mg l\u22121) is favourable for iron uptake by A. flos-aquae. Our experiments also revealed that the process of separating iron from complex iron before entering algal cells was probably as follows: iron complexed with organic ligands were firstly adsorbed on the surface of algae cells; afterwards, iron ions were captured by organic matter on the surface of algae cells, accompanied by the rupture of the bond between Fe3+ and ligand; finally, the Fe3+ entered into the cell of algae while the organic ligands returned to the medium.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

systems. We aimed to develop a machine learning-based prediction of COVID-19 diagnosis and design a graphical user interface (GUI) to diagnose COVID-19 cases by recording their symptoms and demographic features. Methods: We imple-mented different classification models including support vector machine (SVM), Decision tree (DT), Na\u00efve Bayes (NB) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) to predict the result of COVID-19 test for individ-uals. We trained these models by data of 16973 individuals (90% of all individuals included in data gathering) and tested by 1885 individuals (10% of all individuals). Maximum relevance minimum redundancy (MRMR) algorithms used to score features for prediction of result of COVID-19 test. A user-friendly GUI was designed to predict COVID-19 test results in individuals. Results: Study re-sults revealed that coughing had the highest positive correlation with the positive results of COVID-19 test followed by the duration of having COVID-19 signs and symptoms, exposure to infected individuals, age, muscle pain, recent infection by COVID-19 virus, fever, respiratory distress, loss of smell or taste, nausea, anorexia, headache, vertigo, CT symptoms in lung scans, diabetes and hyper-tension. The values of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, specificity and area under receiver oper-ating curve (AUROC) of different classification models computed in different setting of features scored by MRMR algorithm. Finally, our designed GUI by receiving each of the 42 features and symptoms from the users and through selecting one of the SVM, KNN, Na\u00efve Bayes and decision tree models, predict the result of COVID-19 test. The accuracy, AUROC and F1-score of SVM model as the best model for diagnosis of COVID-19 test were 0.7048 (95% CI: 0.6998, 0.7094), 0.7045 (95% CI: 0.7003, 0.7104) and 0.7157 (95% CI: 0.7043, 0.7194), respectively. Conclusion: In this study we implemented a machine learning approach to facilitate early clinical decision making during COVID-19 outbreak and provide a predictive model of COVID-19 diagnosis capable of categorizing populations in to infected and non-infected individuals the same as an efficient screening tool.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine\", \"Neurology (clinical)\", \"Neurology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [105, 0, 1476], "string": "title={Frequency-Dependent Changes in Cerebral Metabolic Rate of Oxygen during Activation of Human Visual Cortex}, container_title={}, abstract={To test the hypothesis that brain oxidative metabolism is significantly increased upon adequate stimulation, we varied the presentation of a visual stimulus to determine the frequency at which the metabolic response would be at maximum. The authors measured regional CMR O2 in 12 healthy normal volunteers with the ECAT EXACT HR+ (CTI/Siemens, Knoxville, TN, U.S.A.) three-dimensional whole-body positron emission tomograph (PET). In seven successive activating conditions, subjects viewed a yellow-blue annular checkerboard reversing its contrast at frequencies of 0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 50 Hz. Stimulation began 4 minutes before and continued throughout the 3-minute dynamic scan. In the baseline condition, the subjects began fixating a cross hair 30 seconds before the scan and continued to do so for the duration of the 3-minute scan. At the start of each scan, the subjects inhaled 20 mCi of 15O-O2 in a single breath. The CMR O2 value was calculated using a two-compartment, weighted integration method. Normalized PET images were averaged across subjects and coregistered with the subjects' magnetic resonance imaging in stereotaxic space. Mean subtracted image volumes (activation minus baseline) of CMR O2 then were obtained and converted to z statistic volumes.

cells lead to striking pattern formations which have been the subject of intense focus among the physics and applied mathematics community for many years. In recent times, much attention has been devoted to devising strategies for controlling such patterns and reducing the growth of the interfacial fingers. We continue this research by reporting on numerical simulations, based on the level set method, of a generalised Hele-Shaw model for which the geometry of the Hele-Shaw cell is altered. First, we investigate how imposing constant and time-dependent injection rates in a Hele-Shaw cell that is either standard, tapered or rotating can be used to reduce the development of viscous fingering when an inviscid fluid is injected into a viscous fluid over a finite time period. We perform a series of numerical experiments comparing the effectiveness of each strategy to determine how these non-standard Hele-Shaw configurations influence the morphological features of the inviscid\u2013viscous fluid interface. Surprisingly, a converging or diverging taper of the plates leads to reduced metrics of viscous fingering at the final time when compared to the standard parallel configuration, especially with carefully chosen injection rates; for the rotating plate case, the effect is even more dramatic, with sufficiently large rotation rates completely stabilising the interface. Next, we illustrate how the number of non-splitting fingers can be controlled by injecting the inviscid fluid at a time-dependent rate while increasing the gap between the plates. Our simulations compare well with previous experimental results for various injection rates and geometric configurations. We demonstrate how the number of non-splitting fingers agrees with that predicted from linear stability theory up to some finger number; for larger values of our control parameter, the fully nonlinear dynamics of the problem leads to slightly fewer fingers than this linear prediction.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Computer Science Applications\", \"History\", \"Education\"]", "language": "en", "length": [84, 0, 488], "string": "title={Small-disturbance temperature diagnostics in vortex tube with a square cross-section}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract The temperature diagnostics in the Ranque-Hilsh vortex was based on the scanning with the special temperature sensor of small size.

is produced everyday from oil and gas production wells. Most of this volume is injected through either saltwater disposal wells or used for water flooding and enhanced recovery purposes. Usually, the regulations require the injection to be conducted through the injector well tubing that is isolated from the well annulus to protect the underground source of drinking water (USDW) by preventing any possible leak through the well casing. Monitoring of the annulus pressure during injection ensures the well integrity. The annulus pressure changes can occur by one of the following mechanisms: thermal expansion of the annulus fluid; ballooning of the injection tubing; communication between the tubing and the annulus; or fluid migration behind the casing. Determining the communication mechanism can be a complex process and a need may arise to run several testing procedures and inspect all the wellbore components. Successful evaluation of the annulus pressure values and trends can directly identify the root cause of the annulus pressure buildup and simultaneously save time and reduce the cost associated with the workover operations. The seven case studies presented in this paper focus on the details pertaining to the annulus pressure buildup under different well conditions and purposes the interpretation technique for each

When the intestinal function during mucositis would be known, a rational feeding strategy might improve the nutritional state, accelerate recuperation, and increase survival of mucositis patients. We developed a methotrexate (MTX)-induced mucositis rat model to study nutrient digestion and absorption. To determine lactose digestion and absorption of its derivative glucose during mucositis, we injected Wistar rats intravenously with MTX (60 mg/kg) or 0.9% NaCl (controls). Four days later, we orally administered trace amounts of [1-13C]lactose and [U-13C]glucose and quantified the appearance of labeled glucose in the blood for 3 h. Finally, we determined plasma citrulline level and harvested the small intestine to assess histology, myeloperoxidase level, glycohydrolase activity, immunohistochemical protein, and mRNA expression. MTX-treated rats showed profound villus atrophy and epithelial damage. During the experimental period, the absorption of lactose-derived [1-13C]glucose was 4.2-fold decreased in MTX-treated rats compared with controls ( P 13C]glucose absorption correlated strongly with villus length (rho = 0.86, P 13C]glucose during the experimental period. We conclude that lactose digestion is severely decreased during mucositis while glucose absorption is still intact, when supplied in trace amounts. Plasma citrulline level might be a useful objective, noninvasive marker for lactose maldigestion during mucositis in clinic.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Economics and Econometrics\", \"Development\"]", "language": "es", "length": [185, 0, 703], "string": "title={Felix C\u00e1dena Barqu\u00edn (coordinador), De la econom\u00eda popular a la econom\u00eda de solidaridad.

abundance of individual oligomannosyl residues in Candida mannoprotein, the major antigenic determinant located on the outer surface of the yeast cell wall. The single terminal aldehydes of oligomannosyl residues released by hydrolysis were tagged with the charged fluorophore 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (ANTS) and separated with high resolution on the basis of size by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. ANTS fluorescence labeling was not biased by oligomannoside length; therefore, band fluorescence intensity was directly related to the relative abundance of individual oligomannoside moieties in heterogeneous samples. FACE analysis revealed the major oligomannosides released by acid hydrolysis and \u03b2-elimination of Fehling-precipitated mannan from Candida albicans , which were the same as those previously reported in studies based on mass and nuclear magnetic spectroscopic analysis. FACE was also amenable to the analysis of samples obtained by direct hydrolysis of whole yeast cells. Whole-cell acid hydrolysis and whole-cell \u03b2-elimination of two isolates each of C. albicans , C. glabrata , C. krusei , C. lusitaniae , C. parapsilosis , C. rugosa , C. stellatoidea , and C. tropicalis resulted in oligomannoside gel banding patterns that were species and strain specific for the 16 isolates surveyed. Whereas some bands were specific for an individual isolate or species, other bands were shared by two or three species in various groupings. Differences in the mannoprotein composition of C. albicans A9 and four spontaneous cell surface mutants were also detected. Mannan \u201cfingerprints,\u201d or banding pattern profiles, derived from the electrophoretic mobilities of individual bands relative to the migration of acid-hydrolyzed dextran (relative migration index) yielded profiles characteristic of individual isolates not revealed by standard assimilation and biochemical profiles. FACE represents an accessible, sensitive, and quantitative analytical tool enabling the characterization of yeast mannan complexity.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

container_title={}, abstract={In China, pre-Quaternary solid potash deposit has only been discovered in the Simao Basin, and the Lower Cretaceous Mengyejing (MYJ) Formation (Fm.) is the productive layer of potash deposit. In this study, we investigated the clay conglomerates which are distributed in upper and lower members of the potash-bearing salt rock layer. We analyzed the relative contents of major elements (Al2O3, Fe2O3T, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O) and trace elements (B, Ba, Co, Cr, Cu, Ga, Mn, Ni, Rb, Sr, V, Zn, Zr) in the samples. The results show that MgO and CaO in the major elements are rich relative to Post Archean Australian Shale (PAAS), whose average enrichment factor values of the MgO (EFMgO) is 2.61 and CaO (EFCaO) is 4.57, and the others major elements are relatively minor; trace elements (B, Ga, Mn, Zr) are rich relative to PAAS, and the others trace elements are minor relative to PAAS. The study of paleogeographic conditions using various parameters shows that the paleoclimate is generally dry and hot during the period of clay conglomerate deposition, but it was warm and humid in certain periods; the main sedimentary environment is weak oxidation condition with strong oxidation conditions in individual periods; the average value of paleosalinity is ~21\u2030, and the highest is no more than ~92\u2030. The significance of the paleogeographic characteristics of MYJ Fm. to potash mineralization are as follows: (1) they indicates that the clay conglomerates of MYJ Fm. are not clastic sediments in brine formed by seawater, because the paleosalinity of clay conglomerates deposition period is obviously lower than that of seawater; (2) MYJ potassic salt ore is not formed by evaporation and concentration of seawater in clay conglomerates in the sedimentary basin, because there is no carbonate rock and sulfate rock of corresponding scale after the deposition of clay conglomerates in the basin; (3) clay

malignancy and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women in the United States. Early detection is a critical unmet need, as patients have significantly improved prognosis when a tumor is discovered at an early stage, and disease staging for prognosis and treatment strategy is critical to ensure proper clinical management. Major limitations of radiological evaluation of ovarian cancer arise from the inability to consistently detect small lesions. The availability of multiplexed hybrid imaging systems, such as simultaneous PET-MRI scanners, presents unique opportunities to combine the strengths of anatomic, physiologic and molecular detection within a single exam for the purpose of early detection and staging of ovarian cancer. Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) play a critical role in ovarian cancer and are among several promising targets in host-directed therapies in cancer. Here, we will combine the anatomic imaging capabilities of MRI with the highly sensitive molecular imaging capabilities of PET in an orthotopic syngeneic model of ovarian cancer, using [124I]iodo-DPA-713, a macrophage-specific imaging agent to define host signatures to detect and stage ovarian cancer. [124I]DPA-713 is a low molecular weight probe that is selectively trapped within reactive phagocytes in both peripheral and central nervous system tissues, including TAMs, and exhibits very low background retention. Using PET-MRI imaging, this allows for excelling visualization of ovaries and the peritoneal environment. Pieces of ID8-Defb29-VEGF tumor were orthotopically implanted onto the ovary of C57BL6 mice. Subcutaneous ID8-Defb29-VEGF tumors were also imaged for comparison. Bioluminescent imaging (BLI) was used to follow tumor progression, as these cancer cells constitutively express luciferin. Experiments were performed in mice presenting with different disease stages, from early stage when tumors are less than 3 mm with no metastases, to late stage with metastases and ascites present. BLI data were used to stratify the mice into different groups. Specific uptake of the radiotracer was observed within and proximal to the primary tumor at early stages. At later stages, uptake was observed in the peritoneal ascitic fluid and within metastases in the lungs, in addition to clear halos surrounding the primary tumor. These studies are clinically translatable and will facilitate non-invasive detection of a nursery of tumor supporting reactive macrophages. They will also provide insights into ovarian cancer progression that will complement emerging host-directed therapeutics destined for the clinic. Supported by the Hopkins Cancer Center Imaging Fund.

different effects to be identified and detected. In this work time series of the water levels of Belorussian lakes were analysed in order to detect pattern variations, to evaluate quantitatively the transformation of the hydrological regime of lake ecosystems and to develop prediction models. The possibility of plotting predicting models of lake water levels one year in advance was shown. The complication in plotting predicting models is in its individuality, the huge volume of initial data and the impossibility of immediate assessment of the results. Additional complications are caused by the inhomogeneity of time series of water levels in lakes.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Mechanical Engineering\", \"Mechanics of Materials\", \"Building and Construction\", \"Civil and Structural Engineering\"]", "language": "en", "length": [144, 0, 0], "string": "title={Optimization of Life-Cycle Maintenance of Deteriorating Bridges with Respect to Expected Annual System Failure Rate and Expected Cumulative Cost}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Education\", \"Human Factors and Ergonomics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [52, 0, 1198], "string": "title={Environmental certification at M\u00e4lardalen University}, container_title={}, abstract={Aims to describe how the concept of sustainable development, with a focus on the ecological dimension, can be applied practically in an institution for higher education and research.

Ages of the 6 ranged from 58 to 71. Two also had taken part in a high-altitude study in 1929. In their earlier years these subjects had had an increase in hemoglobin concentration beginning with their arrival at high altitude. This response has been well established, especially by the Pike's Peak party led by Haldane and the work of Hurtado and associates in Peru. On the other hand, 5 of the 6 in the 1962 party exhibited a decrease in hemoglobin concentration during the first few days. The greatest decrease was observed in the oldest subject. His hemoglobin was 88% of his sea level value after 9 days at altitude and remained below his sea level value for another week.

Recent studies suggest that the timing of meals may be critically important for weight control and metabolic health. Consuming calories later in the day is associated with greater risks of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Interventional diet studies show more weight loss with early, rather than later, eating. Our team conducted a randomized, crossover study (\"Dinner Time Study\") that compared the metabolic effects of routine dinner (6pm) vs late dinner (10pm) with a fixed sleep period (11pm-7am) in young, healthy adults. We found that late dinner caused an 18% increase in post-prandial glucose and a 10% decrease in dietary fat oxidation. These metabolic consequences in the long term may lead to the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, it remains unclear whether the adverse metabolic effects of late dinner are mediated by circadian misalignment (eating at the \"wrong\" time relative to the body's central circadian clock) or mediated by sleep (eating too close to bedtime, coinciding with the fall in metabolic rate induced by sleep). To address this question, we aim to examine the metabolic effects of early dinner, late dinner, and late dinner followed by delayed sleep, in healthy adults. Methods Dinner Time 2 Study is a randomized crossover trial with 3 treatment arms with a 3-4-week washout period: (1) early dinner + routine sleep; (2) late dinner + routine sleep; (3) late dinner + late sleep. Dinner times and bedtimes will be customized to each participant's central circadian rhythm (assessed by dim light melatonin onset, DLMO). The primary objectives of this study are to (1) examine the metabolic effects of early dinner (DLMO-3h) vs late dinner (DLMO+1h) with a fixed routine bedtime (DLMO+2h); (2) examine the metabolic effects of routine bedtime (DLMO+2h) vs delayed bedtime (DLMO+6h) with a fixed late dinner time (DLMO+1h). We will examine 24-h profiles of glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, triglycerides, and dietary fat oxidation using serial blood sampling and an ingested stable isotope ([2H31] palmitate) tracer. We aim to recruit 20 healthy adults, age 18-30 years old, with a BMI 18-29.9 kg/m2. Participants who perform night shift work or have any sleep disorders or metabolic diseases including diabetes are ineligible. Each participant will have 4 overnight admissions to our Clinical Research Unit (1 DLMO visit and 3 metabolic visits). A total of 3 participants have successfully completed the protocol since recruitment started in 2021. Conclusion Dinner Time 2 will greatly advance our understanding of the interactions between meal timing, sleep timing, and metabolism, which could inform the design and implementation of future studies that leverage chronobiology to combat diabetes and obesity.

Patient and lesion characteristics were evaluated prior to angioplasty and were correlated with 1- and 6-month outcomes.Materials and MethodsThis was an observational study of African American hemodialysis patients who presented for angioplasty of a dysfunctional fistula or graft. Clinical outcomes were ascertained from dialysis facilities 1 month and 6 months after angioplasty. One-month clinical success was defined as dialyzer blood flows of 450 mL/min without complications or interval shunt thrombosis, interventions, or loss of access, which was rarely achieved at 6 months. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations of clinical variables with outcomes.ResultsThere were 150 stenoses treated during 99 procedures performed on 82 patients. The clinical success rate at one month was 67% with no complications as a result of the percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Success at 1 month was positively associated with use of aspirin ( P = .005) and with referral for high venous pressures ( P = .004). Six-month data were available for 81 procedures, with 45.7% requiring repeat angioplasty and 12.3% suffering major complications (thrombectomy, revision surgery, or access abandonment). Major complications were seen predominantly in patients who were not receiving aspirin.ConclusionsAspirin use and high venous pressure were associated with 1-month clinical success and fewer major complications at 6 months.

The aim was to identify factors that influence WTP for nature-based tourist experiences. The study relies on quantitative survey data from 1634 respondents in Norway. The data were analyzed using SPSS. WTP varies according to factors such as escape, recognition, active achievement, esthetics, social and environmental concern, preference for adaptation and type of natural surroundings. Tourists who place importance on, for example, peer recognition and escape, have a higher WTP for nature that is not overcrowded and with little or no adaptation for tourism purposes.

Our previous study found that IUGR altered intestinal microbiota and metabolites in the colon. However, the consequences of IUGR on bile acid metabolism in pigs remained unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the bile acid metabolism in the liver and the profile of bile acid derivatives in the colon of growing pigs with IUGR using bile acid targeted metabolomics. Furthermore, we determined correlations between colonic microbiota composition and metabolites of IUGR and normal birth weight (NBW) pigs at different growth stages that were 7, 21, and 28-day-old, and the average body weight (BW) of 25, 50, and 100 kg of the NBW pigs. Results The results showed that the plasma total bile acid concentration was higher (P P = 0.08) at 28-day-old in IUGR pigs. The hepatic gene expressions related to bile acid synthesis (CYP7A1, CYP27A1, and NTCP) were up-regulated (P ATGL, HSL, and PC) were down-regulated (P P P Unclassified_[Mogibacteriaceae], Lachnospira, and Slackia abundances were negatively correlated (P Unclassified_Clostridiaceae abundance with 6,7-diketolithocholic acid at the 25 kg BW stage. Conclusions These findings suggest that IUGR could affect bile acid and glucolipid metabolism in growing pigs, especially at the 25 kg BW stage, these effects being paralleled by a modification of bile acid derivatives concentrations in the colonic content. The plausible links between these modified parameters are discussed.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Colloid and Surface Chemistry\", \"Biochemistry\", \"Catalysis\"]", "language": "en", "length": [56, 0, 0], "string": "title={Energy-dependent ring opening of cycloalkane parent ions}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Psychiatry and Mental Health\"]", "language": "en", "length": [48, 0, 919], "string": "title={Patients Working Out From a Psychiatric Hospital}, container_title={}, abstract={Outside employment was obtained by 630 resident male patients who had 1447 admissions to a South London Hospital between 1963 and 1969.

abstract={About 40% of the intoxications after drug administration occur in the elderly. A significant proportion of the disease states in elderly patients is related to adverse reactions to prescribed drugs. Declining renal function, a reduction in both renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, is a major contributor to drug toxicity in the elderly. Therefore, a review (based on newer papers from Medline) of age-dependent changes of the kidneys and their consequences for drug therapy in geriatric patients is presented. Renal changes that occur with aging are: a decrease of renal weight, a thickening of the intrarenal vascular intima, sclerogenous changes of the glomeruli, and infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells and fibrosis in the stroma. Altered renal tubular function, including impaired handling of water, sodium, acid, and glucose, is also frequently present in old age. Impaired \u2018endocrinologic\u2019 functioning manifested by changes of the renin-angiotensin system, vitamin D metabolism, and antidiuretic hormone responsiveness has been reported. The aging kidney is constantly exposed to the effects of a variety of potential toxic processes, i.e., drugs and chronic illnesses including hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerotic disease. Renal changes that occur with aging also consist of impairment in the ability to concentrate urine and to conserve sodium and water. These physiological changes increase the risks of volume depletion and prerenal type of acute renal failure. A frequent cause of acute renal failure in the elderly is drug-induced nephropathy. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and diuretics are most often involved. Due to the age-dependent decline of renal function, the pharmacokinetics of many drugs are altered in elderly patients. Therefore, the most important renal function to monitor with aging is the creatinine clearance. Changes in pharmacokinetics of many drugs and most decisions on drug dosage can be based on this information alone, as tubular functions of the kidney decrease at rates paralleling the age-dependent decrease in glomerular filtration rate (which is approximately measured by the creatinine clearance). As a conclusion, age-dependent changes of renal function are not only responsible for changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. In many cases, the kidneys are the target organ of adverse drug reactions too.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

continuity, motion, and energy. The last two equations contain the stress tensor and the heat-flux vector for the material. There are two ways to formulate the stress tensor: (a) One can write a continuum expression for the stress tensor in terms of kinematic tensors, or (b) one can select a molecular model that represents the polymer molecule and then develop an expression for the stress tensor from kinetic theory. The advantage of the kinetic theory approach is that one gets information about the relation between the molecular structure of the polymers and the rheological properties. We restrict the discussion primarily to the simplest stress tensor expressions or constitutive equations containing from two to four adjustable parameters, although we do indicate how these formulations may be extended to give more complicated expressions. We also explore how these simplest expressions are recovered as special cases of a more general framework, the Oldroyd 8-constant model. Studying the simplest models allows us to discover which types of empiricisms or molecular models seem to be worth investigating further. We also explore equivalences between continuum and molecular approaches. We restrict the discussion to several types of simple flows, such as shearing flows and extensional flows, which are of greatest importance in industrial operations. Furthermore, if these simple flows cannot be well described by continuum or molecular models, then it is not necessary to lavish time and energy to apply them to more complex flow problems.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine\", \"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging\", \"Surgery\"]", "language": "en", "length": [95, 31, 1395], "string": "title={Intravascular Ultrasound in Endovascular Stent-Grafts for Peripheral Aneurysm: A Clinical Study}, container_title={Journal of Endovascular Therapy}, abstract={Purpose: To evaluate the potential diagnostic information of intraprocedural intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in patients undergoing endovascular stent-grafting for peripheral aneurysm. Methods: IVUS was used in 17 patients preprocedurally to measure the diameter of the proximal and distal neck and the length of the aneurysm. Balloon and stent-graft sizes were selected based on these measurements. Following stent-graft deployment, angiography and IVUS were used to document stent apposition and the configuration and diameter of the stent-graft. Results: Stent-graft insertion was considered successful in 8 patients based on angiography and IVUS images. In 9 others, both imaging modalities showed inadequate results, necessitating 12 additional procedures: balloon angioplasty for stent-graft stenosis (2) and inadequate stent-graft apposition (1); an additional stent-graft (4); an extra stent (1); thrombectomy (2); and conversion (2) for inadequate stent-graft position and a graft rupture. In these patients, intraprocedural IVUS was superior to angiography in contributing vital information to aid in the selection of the additional interventions.

Fermentative production of biorenewable fuels and chemicals requires the engineering of biocatalysts that can quickly and efficiently convert sugars to target products at a cost that is competitive with existing petrochemical-based processes. It is also important that biocatalysts be robust to extreme fermentation conditions, biomass-derived inhibitors, and their target products. Traditional metabolic engineering has made great advances in this area, but synthetic biology has contributed and will continue to contribute to this field, particularly with next-generation biofuels. This work reviews the use of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology in biocatalyst engineering for biorenewable fuels and chemicals production, such as ethanol, butanol, acetate, lactate, succinate, alanine, and xylitol.

neglected tropical disease and zoonosis that causes remarkable morbidity in humans and has economic importance in the livestock industry worldwide. The growth of this parasite resembles the invasion and proliferation of malignant tumours. Microtubules, especially the \u03b2-tubulin subunit in the exposed end, are the targets of many antitumour drugs. However, the role of TUBB3, which is the most studied isotype in solid tumours and is also a marker of biological aggressiveness associated with the modulation of tumour metastatic abilities in the growth and development of platyhelminths, is unknown. In this study, protoscoleces (PSCs) are cultivated in monophasic medium in vitro. Using electroporated short interfering RNA (siRNA), EmTUBB3 knockdown was performed with two EmTUBB3-specific siRNAs (siRNA-1 and siRNA-2). qRT\u2013PCR was performed to detect the expression of TUBB3. PSCs viability and the evagination rate and number of body contractions were quantified under a light microscope. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to observe the ultra-morphological changes of the parasites. After siRNA interference, the EmTUBB3 expression in E. multilocularis PSCs was significantly reduced. Reduced viability, a decreased evagination rate and a decreased number of body contractions were also documented. In particular, shrinkage and roughness of the tegument were observed.

The wear due to friction is significantly less important, given a proper kinematic coupling and a thorough washout.

predominantly as a dynamic, fluid, multidimensional, and ongoing process. Currently, identity is viewed as a process, as something achieved, and as a product of social relations. Scholars have acknowledged that members of minorities and diasporas can have very complex multiple identities, which are both dependent on social context and changeable over time. This article explores the national and ethnic identifications of Slovaks living in Serbia. Its main objective is to examine how the members of the Slovak diaspora identify themselves and what kind of national and ethnic awareness and pride they hold. As well, this paper explores their opinions and attitudes on language and cultural identity. This study used a web-based survey and basic statistics. The results of the explorative study indicate that members of the Slovak diaspora living in Serbia have multiple identities that coexist, do not conflict, and vary in their importance for respondents. Distinct national and ethnic identifications are perceived in different ways and have divergent emotional intensities. This study proposes further research on the importance of civic and ethnic values and on different perceptions of identity, citizenship, length of residency, and minority rights for collective identifications of minorities and/or diasporas.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Physiology (medical)\", \"Clinical Biochemistry\", \"Physiology\"]", "language": "de", "length": [66, 0, 0], "string": "title={Die Erholungslatenz des Warmbl\ufffdtergehirns nach kompletter Isch\ufffdmie}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Literature and Literary Theory\"]", "language": "en", "length": [84, 19, 513], "string": "title={W prze\u015bwitach poezji i filozofii, czyli tam, gdzie spotykaj\u0105 si\u0119 Le\u015bmian i Heidegger}, container_title={Przestrzenie Teorii}, abstract={The article presents the phenomenon of clearance in both the poetry of Boles\u0142aw Le\u015bmian and the philosophy of Martin Heidegger.

Zu den vordringlichen Zielen von Public Health geh\u00f6rt es daher, den Tabakkonsum in der Bev\u00f6lkerung zu reduzieren. Wie die Tabaksteuerstatistik und bev\u00f6lkerungsweite Studien zeigen, ist sowohl der Zigarettenabsatz als auch der Anteil der Jugendlichen und Erwachsenen, die rauchen, in den letzten 25 Jahren deutlich zur\u00fcckgegangen. Diese positive Entwicklung ist sicherlich auch auf Ma\u00dfnahmen zur\u00fcckzuf\u00fchren, die im Zuge einer verst\u00e4rkten Tabakkontrollpolitik in Deutschland umgesetzt wurden. Insbesondere beim konsequenten und fl\u00e4chendeckenden Nichtraucherschutz, bei der Tabaksteuer und bei umfassenden Tabakwerbeverboten besteht weiterhin Potential zur Verbesserung.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)\"]", "language": "en", "length": [53, 0, 0], "string": "title={Harrow Disk Curvature \u0097 Influence on Soil Penetration}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Animal Science and Zoology\", \"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [126, 20, 0], "string": "title={An annotated checklist of the freshwater cladocerans (Crustacea: Branchiopoda: Cladocera) of Ecuador and the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands}, container_title={Invertebrate Zoology}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Physical and Theoretical Chemistry\"]", "language": "en", "length": [103, 0, 0], "string": "title={Perturbation\u2010response treatment of thermodynamic potentials.

of freedom of contract and free movement law. The former is not only expressed in the freedom to choose with whom to enter into a contract and shape its content, but it is also manifested in the freedom to decide whether or not to opt out of non-mandatory contract law rules. In this regard, the article examines the extent to which the boundaries of free movement law in a contractual context could be considered to be essentially defined by the reach of such forms of contractual discretion. In addressing this query, it draws a distinction in the role of contractual discretion in the context of individual ways of coordination of contractual relationships in the form of individual contractual preferences and national ones in the form of non-mandatory contract law rules. Unlike the former, it is submitted that contractual discretion should not be taken as a decisive factor in determining the scope of free movement law as regards non-mandatory contract law rules. In particular, it is suggested to consider these rules to fall outside the scope of free movement law because of them themselves not having an effect on free movement as such, rather than due to contracting parties\u2019 discretion over their applicability.

Au cours de cette analyse, il \u00e9tablit une distinction entre le r\u00f4le du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire contractuel dans le contexte des modalit\u00e9s individuelles de coordination des relations contractuelles sous la forme de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences contractuelles individuelles et des modalit\u00e9s nationales sous la forme de r\u00e8gles non imp\u00e9ratives de droit des contrats. \u00c0 l\u2019oppos\u00e9, il est soumis que le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire contractuel ne devrait pas \u00eatre vu comme un facteur d\u00e9cisif dans la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019\u00e9tendue de la libert\u00e9 de circulation en ce qui concerne les r\u00e8gles non imp\u00e9ratives de droit des contrats. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, il est propos\u00e9 de consid\u00e9rer que ces r\u00e8gles ne rel\u00e8vent pas de la l\u00e9gislation sur la libert\u00e9 de circulation parce qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas en elles-m\u00eames un effet sur la libert\u00e9 de circulation en tant que telle, mais plut\u00f4t en raison du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire des parties contractantes sur leur applicabilit\u00e9.}",

food insecurity (FI) is a living reality for many households, particularly among the most vulnerable groups. The burden of household FI in Mozambique and how FI and coping strategies relate to perceived health are unknown. This study investigated the lived experiences and coping strategies of food-insecure households, along with their perceived health. Altogether, 16 in-depth interviews were performed, audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. A qualitative content analysis was carried out and five themes emerged: lived experiences of FI, coping strategies used in situations of FI, food choices, climate change and food security, and FI and perceived health. A wide range of lived experiences and coping strategies were reported, including cooking whatever is available, skipping meals, receiving money or food from friends and relatives, eating unsafe and low-quality foods, taking on additional work, cooking least-preferred foods, and having a monotonous and less-nutritious diet. Furthermore, the participants reported emotional distress, anxiety and depression, substance use, and other negative health outcomes. Some had diagnoses of hypertension, diabetes or HIV/AIDS. The findings suggest the need for employment creation and women\u2019s empowerment, as well as the implementation of appropriate policies and programmes to alleviate household FI.}",

Transfusion medicine is a complex process dependent on a variety of professionals interacting effectively and efficiently across time and distance. To perform safely, professionals depend on their own knowledge and skills, the knowledge and skills of others, and the overall effectiveness of operating systems. Nursing is an essential link in the process. To be effective, nurses need to practice in environments that recognize the importance of reducing error and improving safety through use of nonpunitive system approaches to analyzing near misses and errors. The \u201coff-with-their-heads\u201d approach must be eliminated. To increase efficiency, pathologists and nurses should collaborate on form development, evaluation, and implementation. Documentation regarding transfusions needs to be simplified and coordinated. Knowledgeable staff is an essential element of safe systems. Basic knowledge should never be assumed. Mechanisms to monitor knowledge of key processes along with ongoing feedback and remediation are necessary to maximize performance.

types of physiological or growth analysis studies in forest research. While many methods are available to estimate surface area, there is still a need for an accurate, rapid measurement technique for species with three- or four-sided needle morphology. I propose a regression technique with length and displaced volume as the independent variables. The regression technique is an improvement over the use of displaced volume and length in direct geometric calculation as it does not assume a constant needle morphology. The regression technique gives more accurate results than direct calculation, is comparable in precision, and is necessary to counter bias where variation in the cross-sectional shape of foliage is related to the treatment or variable under study. Use of regression, however, requires that a subsample of foliage, representing the range of conditions to be studied, be sectioned and measured directly for surface area to develop the estimation

receptors mediated angiogenesis pathway}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Study question What are the underlying mechanisms of melatonin to treat endometriosis? Summary answer Melatonin inhibited estrogen receptors/HIF1\u03b1/VEGF signaling pathway and limited the endometriotic lesions growth and angiogenesis. What is known already Currently, alternative pharmaceutical for endometriosis is needed urgently due to lack of satisfactory treatment option. The role of melatonin in inhibiting progression of endometriosis has attracted widespread attention in recent years. Several experimental animal studies showed melatonin decreased endometriotic lesion volume, albeit the exact mechanism is still unknown. As an estrogen-dependent disease, estrogen can not only stimulate the proliferation and growth of endometriotic lesions, but also stabilize HIF-1\u03b1 and thus promote HIF-1\u03b1\u2013induced VEGF via binding to estrogen receptors. Herein, estrogen receptors might be a therapeutic target to block the lesion growth and angiogenesis, subsequently inhibit the progression of endometriosis. Study design, size, duration We investigated the role of melatonin in endometriosis in vitro and in vivo. Endometriotic epithelial (12Z) and stromal (Hs 832(C).T) cell lines were cultured and treated with melatonin for 24 hours. Subcutaneous endometriotic model was surgically established in C57BL/6 mice, and randomly assigned to receive vehicle or melatonin for 21days. All experiments were performed 3-8 times for comparisons. Participants/materials, setting, methods The effect of melatonin on endometriotic cells was determined by MTT cell viability assay. Endometriotic lesion size and body weight were measured every 2-3 days after transplantation. RNA and protein expressions of estrogen receptors, HIF1\u03b1 and VEGF were detected by qPCR and Western blotting and/or immunostaining in in vitro and in vivo experiments. In vivo imaging by Cellvizio was used to examine microvascular network of the developing endometriotic lesions. Main results and the role of chance Melatonin exerted inhibitory effects on cell growth in a dose and time-dependent manner in 12Z and Hs 832(C).T cell lines, and reduced the volume and weight of the ectopic endometriotic lesions without major change in body weight and behaviour. In addition, melatonin significantly decreased the percentage of area (48.41 vs 33.13%), average length (546.7 vs 240.9um) and total number of junctions (53.30 vs 26.68) of microvessels in the lesions. Melatonin also specially and significantly downregulated estrogen receptor \u03b2 (ER\u03b2) and G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 30 (GPR30) at RNA and protein levels while estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) was not significantly changed in both 12Z and Hs 832(C).T cells and endometriotic lesions. Furthermore, the expressions of downstream HIF1\u03b1 and VEGF were significantly decreased after melatonin treatment. Limitations, reasons for caution Melatonin has been reported to employ a wide range of biological effects. Therefore, its suppressive effects on estrogen receptors/HIF1\u03b1/VEGF signaling pathway might be part of the pharmacological mechanisms to treat endometriosis. Further studies are also needed to explore the therapeutic mechanisms of melatonin from other perspectives. Wider implications of the findings Our findings add mechanistic insight in support of the use of melatonin as an adjuvant therapy in the management of endometriosis. Melatonin shows the potential to act as a novel alternative therapeutic drug to treat endometriosis with fewer side effects.

With the aid of mode coupling, quantitative analysis of the modulational instability is explored in the parameter space of pump power and detuning. By exploring the coupled mode number, dispersion, and coupling strength in the normalized Lugiato-Lefever model, the modulational stability gain exists and yields extended spatial structures within the regime of eigenvalue bifurcations. Moreover, the dynamics and efficiency of microcombs are discussed, providing the accessibility of high-efficient, stable, and controllable combs.

A case note on the Supreme Court judgment in Peninsula Securities Ltd v. Dunnes Stores (Bangor) Ltd}, container_title={}, abstract={In Peninsula Securities, the Supreme Court held that a restrictive covenant, granted in a lease to an anchor tenant of a shopping centre not to allow any retail unit in the centre to be leased to competing shops, does not engage the doctrine of restraint of trade. The question of its enforceability therefore hinges on whether the relevant covenant breaches competition law, and specifically whether it is anti-competitive by object or effect. This relatively straightforward conclusion of the Supreme Court in Peninsula Securities masks over 50 years of conflicting judgments and uncertainty in the area. Prior to Peninsula Securities, the majority decision of the House of Lords in Esso Petroleum v Harper's Garage gave rise to a \u2018battle of the tests\u2019: the majority opined that the doctrine of restraint of trade would only be engaged if the covenantor contracts to give up a freedom they already had (what has come to be known as the \u2018pre-existing freedom test\u2019; Lord Wilberforce, dissenting, formulated what came to be known as the \u2018trading society test\u2019 which is basically a rule of reason test. In Peninsula Securities, the Supreme Court clearly sided with the latter, but in reality neither test is likely to be considered in future challenges to an anchor tenancy restrictive covenant \u2013 the key question is whether it is anti-competitive, something which only the relevant facts of the case will determine.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

The algorithm can alert operators and maintenance personnel of abnormal conditions in a timely manner. In the proposed algorithm, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient is used to display the correlation between phase currents, and its t statistic is used to determine whether there is an abnormality in the determined data collection based on hypothesis testing. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by using the actual data collected from the power grid, and the characteristics of normal and abnormal conditions are analyzed separately. Sensitivity analyses were performed for different significance levels and sampling rates to consider their impact on monitoring results. The application results show that the power grid recovered a total of 12.98 million yuan from 136 households with a power consumption of 17.57 GWh, proving the practicability of the algorithm.

For pupils with a traumatic experience, school can be a very challenging environment and an unpleasant experience. Problems with: concentration, ability to sit still and calmly follow classes, self-regulation skills, as well as difficulties in establishing and maintaining relationships with peers and adults are expected for traumatized school-age children. All of the above can lead to low educational achievement. In this article, the emphasis is on children and young people whose chronic traumatic experience is happening at home environment. Research indicates that the importance of teaching and other school staff is very significant in recognizing the presence of childhood trauma in the classroom, because the earlier the trauma is recognized, the sooner help can be provided to the child. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to present contemporary theoretical knowledge and explain why school practice should be trauma informed. Adverse childhood experiences and trauma will be explained, also will be presented by which parameters teaching and non-teaching staff can recognize traumatized pupils in their classrooms, acquiring competencies for recognizing signs of traumatization and understanding what challenges traumatization poses to children and their ability to learn. In addition, it is important to raise awareness and recognize that trauma has consequences for those adults who work with traumatized children.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Biochemistry\"]", "language": "en", "length": [140, 0, 0], "string": "title={A Water-insoluble Polyanionic Derivative of Trypsin.

Incorporating these mutations into the nonpathogenic A/swine/Korea/1130/2009(H1N2, Sw/1130) virus consequently altered pathogenicity and growth in animal models but could not establish efficient transmission or noticeable disease. We therefore exploited various reassortants of these two viruses to better understand and identify other viral factors responsible for pathogenicity, transmissibility, or both. We found that possession of the CT-Sw/1204 tripartite viral polymerase enhanced replicative ability and pathogenicity in mice more significantly than did expression of individual polymerase subunit proteins. In ferrets, homologous expression of viral RNA polymerase complex genes in the context of the mutant Sw/1130 carrying the HA 225G and NA 315N modifications induced optimal replication in the upper nasal and lower respiratory tracts and also promoted efficient aerosol transmission to respiratory droplet contact ferrets. These data show that the synergistic function of the tripartite polymerase gene complex of CT-Sw/1204 is critically important for virulence and transmission independent of the surface glycoproteins. Sequence comparison results reveal putative differences that are likely to be responsible for variation in disease. Our findings may help elucidate previously undefined viral factors that could expand the host range and disease severity induced by triple-reassortant swine viruses, including the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, and therefore further justify the ongoing development of novel antiviral drugs targeting the viral polymerase complex subunits.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

analyze the concept of transfer anxiety in parents of children transferred from pediatric intensive care units to general wards.Methods: The hybrid model by Schwarz-Barcott and Kim was used to analyze the characteristics of transfer anxiety in parents of children transferred from pediatric intensive care units to general wards.Results: Transfer anxiety was defined by the following attributes: 1) stress concerning the adaptation process, 2) concern about the child\u2019s condition worsening due to the parent\u2019s caregiving, and 3) involuntary changes in daily life due to the treatment. Transfer anxiety has the following antecedents: 1) uncertainty; 2) a lack of knowledge about the illness, medical devices, and caregiving; and 3) a lack of social support. It resulted in 1) caregiver burden, 2) a decrease in the capacity for coping with caregiving, 3) delays in the child\u2019s physical and psychological recovery, and 4) decreased quality of life.Conclusion: It is necessary to develop an assessment scale that considers the attributes of transfer anxiety in parents of children transferred from pediatric intensive care units to general wards. Furthermore, an effective nursing intervention should be developed to reduce transfer anxiety.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

their translational potential is limited by an immature phenotype. We hypothesized that large-scale manufacturing of mature hPSC-CMs could be achieved through culture on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-lined roller bottles and that the transplantation of these cells would mediate better structural and functional outcomes than with conventional immature hPSC-CM populations. Methods: We comprehensively phenotyped hPSC-CMs after in vitro maturation for 20 and 40 days on either PDMS or standard tissue culture plastic substrates. All hPSC-CMs were generated from a transgenic hPSC line that stably expressed a voltage-sensitive fluorescent reporter to facilitate in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological studies, and cardiomyocyte populations were also analyzed in vitro by immunocytochemistry, ultrastructure and fluorescent calcium imaging, and bulk and single-cell transcriptomics. We next compared outcomes after the transplantation of these populations into a guinea pig model of myocardial infarction using end points including histology, optical mapping of graft- and host-derived action potentials, echocardiography, and telemetric electrocardiographic monitoring. Results: We demonstrated the economic generation of >1\u00d710 8 mature hPSC-CMs per PDMS-lined roller bottle. Compared with their counterparts generated on tissue culture plastic substrates, PDMS-matured hPSC-CMs exhibited increased cardiac gene expression and more mature structural and functional properties in vitro. More important, intracardiac grafts formed with PDMS-matured myocytes showed greatly enhanced structure and alignment, better host-graft electromechanical integration, less proarrhythmic behavior, and greater beneficial effects on contractile function.

To investigate the potential effects of P4 on the canine oviduct, the expression of nuclear (PR) and membrane (PGRMC1 and 2, mPR\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3) P4 receptors was studied by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Oviducts were collected from Beagle bitches after the onset of pro-oestrus and before the LH peak (Pre-LH), after the LH peak and before ovulation (Pre-ov) and on Days 1, 4 and 7 post-ovulation (n = 6 bitches/stage). PR mRNA concentrations decreased from Pre-LH to Day 7 in the ampulla and isthmus, whereas both PGRMC1 and 2 mRNA levels increased over the same period. The main change in mPR expression was an increase in mPR\u03b2 and \u03b3 mRNAs at Day 7 in the isthmus. Furthermore, PR proteins were expressed in the nuclei of luminal epithelial, stromal and muscular cells, whereas the expression of PGRMCs and mPRs was primarily cytoplasmic and localised in the luminal epithelium. The immunostaining for PR decreased at Day 4 in the stroma and muscle, whereas it remained strong in the epithelium from Pre-LH to Day 7. PGRMC1 staining was strong at Days 4 and 7 whereas PGRMC2 was highly expressed from Pre-ov to Day 7. The most intense immunostaining signals for all three mPRs were observed at Day 7.

eyelid closure is involved in involutional lower eyelid entropion. Methods This prospective observational study included 34 sides from 27 patients with involutional lower eyelid entropion. The positional relationship between the upper and the affected lower eyelid margins during eyelid closure were examined before and after posterior layer advancement of the lower eyelid retractors. In addition, we preoperatively examined whether the affected lower eyelid turned in during a voluntary maximum force eyelid closure from the normal position. We then held the upper eyelid away from the lower eyelid during a voluntary maximum force eyelid closure to eliminate the influence of an inward upper eyelid push on the lower eyelid margin. At the time, we investigated whether the affected lower eyelid turned in. All these examinations were performed from the normal lower eyelid position. Results Although the upper eyelid margin was on the lower eyelid margin before surgery, this was corrected after surgery in all patients. All affected lower eyelids turned in after voluntary maximum force eyelid closure. However, the lower eyelid margin did not show an inward rotation with holding of the upper eyelid away from the lower eyelid.

Elderly persons who enter a retirement home must undergo a process that requires them to first disappropriate their old objects and then reappropriate the new ones that furnish their rooms. The order in which this process occurs is as follows: first, objects from their former residence; second, objects acquired after entry into a home; and, third, objects belonging to the retirement home. After the existence of this process had been verified in a sample of 130 residents aged 67 to 98 years, it was demonstrated that the evaluation tool used in this study significantly correlates with the scale developed by Castonguay and Ferron (1999) that measures elderly persons' adjustment to their environments (EAPAR), as well as with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), which evaluates levels of depression.

Peptide-2-Stimulated GH Secretion}, container_title={The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism}, abstract={Female gender confers resistance to GH autonegative feedback in the adult rat, thereby suggesting gonadal or estrogenic modulation of autoregulation of the somatotropic axis. Here we test the clinical hypothesis that short-term E2 replacement in ovariprival women reduces GH\u2019s repression of spontaneous, GHRH-, and GH-releasing peptide (GHRP)-stimulated GH secretion. To this end, we appraised GH autoinhibition in nine healthy postmenopausal volunteers during a prospective, randomly ordered supplementation with placebo vs. E [1 mg micronized 17\u03b2-E2 orally twice daily for 6\u201323 d]. The GH autofeedback paradigm consisted of a 6-min pulsed iv infusion of recombinant human GH (10 \u03bcg/kg square-wave injection) or saline (control) followed by iv bolus GHRH (1 \u03bcg/kg), GHRP-2 (1\u03bc g/kg), or saline 2 h later. Blood was sampled every 10 min and serum GH concentrations were measured by chemiluminescence. Poststimulus GH release was quantitated by multiparameter deconvolution analysis using published biexponential kinetics and by the incremental peak serum GH concentration response (maximal poststimulus value minus prepeak nadir). Outcomes were analyzed on the logarithmic scale by mixed-effects ANOVA at a multiple-comparison type I error rate of 0.05. E2 supplementation increased the (mean \u00b1 sem) serum E2 concentration from 43 \u00b1 1.8 (control) to 121 \u00b1 4 pg/ml (E2) (158 \u00b1 6.6 to 440 \u00b1 15 pmol/liter; P &lt; 0.001), lowered the 0800 h (preinfusion) serum IGF-I concentration from 127 \u00b1 7.7 to 73 \u00b1 3.6\u03bc g/liter (P &lt; 0.01), and amplified spontaneous pulsatile GH production from 7.5 \u00b1 1.1 to 13 \u00b1 2.3\u03bc g/liter per 6 h (P = 0.020). In the absence of exogenously imposed GH autofeedback, E2 replacement enhanced the stimulatory effect of GHRP-2 on incremental peak GH release by 1.58-fold [95% confidence interval, 1.2- to 2.1-fold] (P = 0.0034) but did not alter the action of GHRH (0.83-fold [0.62- to 1.1-fold]). In the E2-deficient state, bolus GH infusion significantly inhibited subsequent spontaneous, GHRH-, and GHRP-induced incremental peak GH responses by, respectively, 33% (1\u201355%; P = 0.044 vs. saline), 79% (68\u201386%; P &lt; 0.0001), and 54% (32\u201369%; P = 0.0002). E2 repletion failed to influence GH autofeedback on either spontaneous or GHRH-stimulated incremental peak GH output. In contrast, E2 replenishment augmented the GHRP-2-stimulated incremental peak GH response in the face of GH autoinhibition by 1.7-fold (1.2- to 2.5-fold; P = 0.009). Mechanistically, the latter effect of E2 mirrored its enhancement of GH-repressed/GHRP-2-stimulated GH secretory pulse mass, which rose by 1.5-fold (0.95- to 2.5-fold over placebo; P = 0.078). In summary, the present clinical investigation documents the ability of short-term oral E2 supplementation in postmenopausal women to selectively rescue GHRP-2 (but not spontaneous or GHRH)-stimulated GH secretion from autonegative feedback.

Method We collected data prospectively for surgical patients admitted between 25/02/21\u201318/03/21 (first cycle) & 12/09/2021\u20134/10/2021 (2nd cycle). Maximum of 5 patients daily randomly selected. Data collected on wards after clerking on Day 1 of admission. Surgical Proforma was used to identify time of admission, presenting history and co-morbidities of patients. NEWS Charts used to identify observations of patients on admission. Drug charts used to assess volume and types of intravenous fluids prescribed. Admissions by audit authors were excluded to prevent selection bias. Intervention Posters in Emergency Assessment Unit and Wards, Teaching to junior doctors, Regular reminder messages to on-call teams. Results 72 patients included in audit. Prescription of Intravenous resuscitation fluids in Acute Surgical Patients in compliance with NICE guidelines rose from 49% to 69% between cycle 1 and 2, respectively. Correct prescriptions in volume and type of fluid rose from 2% (cycle 1) to 44% (cycle 2). Conclusions Almost one third of acute admissions met the criteria for resuscitation IV fluids.

plant-size traits of Eucalyptus species using neural networks}, container_title={}, abstract={AbstractIn forest modeling to estimate the volume of wood, artificial intelligence has been shown to be quite efficient, especially using artificial neural networks (ANNs). Here we tested whether diameter at breast height (DBH) and the total plant height (Ht) of eucalyptus can be predicted at the stand level using spectral bands measured by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral sensor and vegetation indices. To do so, using the data obtained by the UAV as input variables, we tested different configurations (number of hidden layers and number of neurons in each layer) of ANNs for predicting DBH and Ht at stand level for different Eucalyptus species. The experimental design was randomized blocks with four replicates, with 20 trees in each experimental plot. The treatments comprised five Eucalyptus species (E. camaldulensis, E. uroplylla, E. saligna, E. grandis, and E. urograndis) and Corymbria citriodora. DBH and Ht for each plot at the stand level were measured seven times in separate overflights by the UAV, so that the multispectral sensor could obtain spectral bands to calculate vegetation indices (VIs). ANNs were then constructed using spectral bands and VIs as input layers, in addition to the categorical variable (species), to predict DBH and Ht at the stand level simultaneously. This report represents one of the first applications of high-throughput phenotyping for plant size traits in Eucalyptus species. In general, ANNs containing three hidden layers gave better statistical performance (higher estimated r, lower estimated root mean squared error\u2013RMSE) due to their greater capacity for self-learning. Among these ANNs, the best contained eight neurons in the first layer, seven in the second, and five in the third (8 \u2212 7 \u2212 5). The results reported here reveal the potential of using the generated models to perform accurate forest inventories based on spectral bands and VIs obtained with a UAV multispectral sensor and ANNs, reducing labor and time.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [72, 19, 0], "string": "title={Photographic Evaluation of an Airborne Night Vision System's Performance}, container_title={Optical Engineering}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Artificial Intelligence\", \"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\", \"Signal Processing\", \"Software\"]", "language": "en", "length": [56, 0, 0], "string": "title={Data synthesis method preserving correlation of features}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"History and Philosophy of Science\"]", "language": "en", "length": [68, 0, 0], "string": "title={Some methodological and historical considerations in low temperature}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Religious Studies\"]", "language": "en", "length": [153, 24, 0], "string": "title={The Cosmic Common Good: Religious Grounds for Ecological Ethics By Daniel P.

The test bed for this study was a statistically representative sample of Texas\u2019 older bridge-class reinforced concrete box culvert structures. Rating factors were determined using the load factor rating method with demands calculated from a production-simplified, calibrated, two-dimensional soil\u2013structure interaction model using linear elastic constitutive models for both concrete and soil. The study was motivated in part by research which showed that SHVs create force effects significantly greater than those from the HS-20 truck (for bridges proper), and recent federal policy mandating that states load rate their bridges for SHVs. Findings from this study indicate the standard HS-20 truck, and not SHVs or other legal or design loads, is the critical model for most culvert load rating applications. In particular, operating rating factors calculated from both the AASHTO legal loads and SHV models tend to be higher than corresponding rating factors calculated using the HS-20 standard truck, most of the time. The response is explained primarily by considering the relatively short span length of culvert structures and the load-attenuating benefit of cover soil above the culvert top slab. More detailed exploration of rating variables suggests interactions between culvert geometry, cover soil thickness, and the various types of applied vehicle loads.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cognitive Neuroscience\", \"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)\"]", "language": "en", "length": [52, 0, 302], "string": "title={A Floating-Gate MOS Implementation of Resistive Fuse}, container_title={}, abstract={Resistive fuses are key elements in weak string filters, which smooth out noise while detecting step edges inherent in original data.

Surgical intervention (SI) is the first line treatment, although transcatheter intervention (TI) is gaining ground as an alternative. However, there are no randomized studies comparing both techniques. Purpose The aim of this study is to compare the short and long-term outcomes in patients with symptomatic PVL undergoing SI or TI. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent SI or TI for PVL between 2004 and 2020 in our institution. The primary endpoint (PE) was the composite of cardiovascular mortality, readmission for HF and reintervention for PVL up to 24 months after the procedure. The secondary endpoints were admission length, technical and procedural success, and rate of complications. The definition of technical success was the correct placement of the device with no impaired function of the valve prosthesis and with \u2264 grade II residual regurgitation. Procedural success was defined when there was technical success with no presentation of intervention-related complications. Results Picture 1 provides information about the clinical and procedural characteristics, initial outcome and outcome during follow-up. A total 85 procedures, 39 transcatheter (45.9%) and 46 surgical (54.1%), were performed on 67 patients. The patients who underwent TI were older (67.5 versus 61.4 years; p=0.03) had a worse functional class (NYHA III-IV 100% versus 80%; p=0.02), a lower frequency of previous endocarditis (22.2% versus 52.2%; p=0.03) and higher surgical risk (EuroScore 18.7 versus 10.4 and EuroScore II 8.6 versus 5.6; both p=0.001). The hospital stay was significantly shorter for TI (10.2 versus 30.4 days; p=0.009). Additionally, although without statistical significance, there was a lower frequency of complications (41% versus 58.7; p=0.16) and less technical success (69.2% versus 86.7%; p=0.052). There were no differences between procedure success (61.5% versus 71.1%, p=0.49). Regarding PE, at 24 months there were no differences in event-free survival (TI 55.9% versus SI 64.1%; Log-Rank p=0.8) (Picture 2). Conclusion The main finding of our study was the absence of significant differences in the short and long-term outcomes (composite of cardiovascular mortality, readmission for HF and reintervention) between surgical versus percutaneous closure. In conclusion, transcatheter intervention must be considered as a good alternative, particularly in high-risk surgical patients. Funding Acknowledgement Type of funding sources: None. Picture 1.

Patients in both groups were followed up at 3 months to determine the number of TRPs end of the study. Patients in the active group completed a validated, Likert scale MMR-satisfaction questionnaire. Factors affecting satisfaction were assessed through multiple regression analysis. Key findings Outpatients with chronic conditions (n = 160) were recruited into the study, with mean age 53.01 \u00b1 15.39; mean number of medical conditions of 3.56 \u00b1 1.15 and 4.73 \u00b1 1.79 mean number of medications. A mean number of 5.37 \u00b1 3.01 TRPs per patient was identified, with no significant difference between both groups (active group n = 82, 5.57 \u00b1 2.68; control n = 78, 5.18 \u00b1 3.36, P = 0.412). At follow-up, significantly lower number of TRPs were identified for patients in the active group compared to patients in the control group (1.06 \u00b1 1.30 versus 4.53 \u00b1 3.43, P &lt; 0.001). Majority of patients were satisfied/very satisfied with the service (n = 77, 94.5%). A lower number of TRPs at follow-up (B = \u22120.438; t = \u22124.477, P &lt; 0.001) and higher number of TRPs agreed upon and implemented (B = 0.553; t = 6.949, P &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with higher level of patient satisfaction. Conclusion The MMR has proven to be an effective pharmaceutical care service when delivered in a developing country, such as Jordan. It led to high patient satisfaction, which was significantly associated with lower number of TRPs at follow-up.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Physiology (medical)\", \"Neurology (clinical)\"]", "language": "en", "length": [50, 0, 3379], "string": "title={0805 Halo-Traction induced Obstructive sleep apnea}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Introduction Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder. It is a multi-factorial disease with a variety of identified causes including age, male gender, obesity, craniofacial and upper airway abnormalities. We would like to describe a patient who had severe OSA following application of Halo traction, which significantly improved following the removal of the device. Report of Cases: 14-year-old male with medical history of spina bifida, chiari malformation s/p decompression, shunted hydrocephalus and severe scoliosis, was admitted to the hospital for anterior spinal discectomy L2-S1 and Halo application with traction for scoliosis. He previously had nocturnal polysomnogram (NPSG) in 2017 that demonstrated very mild mixed apnea with an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) of 5.5. Because central apneas were very brief and clustered in REM, family elected to repeat a study rather than treat. In 2019, he had a follow up study with complaints of snoring and thirst, and this demonstrated an AHI of 21 with 29 brief central apneas and 72 hypopneas, 1 obstructive apnea. He had a T&A and turbinate ablation and due to the global pandemic did not undergo repeat sleep study. During admission for his anterior spinal discectomy and Halo, he demonstrated persistent night time hypoxia. A split night sleep study showed evidence of severe OSA with pretreatment AHI of 94.4, oxygen nadir 86%. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was initiated at 5 cm of water and titrated to 11 cm of water. On CPAP of +11 severe obstructive events continued with an AHI of 40.6, oxygen nadir 92%. A bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) titration study the subsequent night started at pressures of 12/6 and titrated to 21/9 with respiratory rate of 12 yet demonstrated AHI of 51, oxygen nadir 89%. Study transitioned to average volume assisted pressure support (AVAPS) with IPAP max of 26, IPAP minimum of 12 EPAP of 9, tidal volume of 175ml, rate of 12 with inadequate control of his obstructive events with an AHI of 24.8, minimum oxygen saturations of 91. While hospitalized, he remained on AVAPS with normal capillary blood gases. Halo traction was removed 2 weeks following his surgery with plan was to send him home on AVAPS and repeat NPSG in 6 weeks. However, as a result of COVID pandemic/Philips recall, CPAP was the only device available for home use, so CPAP therapy at +8 cm was trialed overnight, demonstrating oxygen nadir of 92% and a normal capillary blood gas in the morning. Patient was then discharged home on CPAP of +8 cm of water. He returned back to sleep center for a BIPAP titration study to re-establish BIPAP/AVAPS settings, as his inpatient sleep study had shown severe OSA. During the sleep study, he was started on BIPAP 12/6 and he remained on it throughout the night with 0 central and 0 obstructive events. As he did well, he was advised to continue CPAP +8 with plans to repeat the sleep study off CPAP. In clinic follow up, he reported mild skin breakdown and occasionally waking unrefreshed. Conclusion As our patient did significantly better following the removal of Halo traction device, it is likely that Halo traction device caused fixed over flexion of the cervical spine that resulted in decrease in his airway diameter, which further worsened during his sleep, and caused severe OSA.

evaluations have not assessed monovalent rotavirus vaccine (RV1, a G1P[8] human rotavirus strain) effectiveness, because of its later introduction (2008). Using case-control methodology, we measured the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the 2-dose RV1 and 3-dose pentavalent vaccine (RV5) series against rotavirus disease resulting in hospital emergency department or inpatient care. METHODS: Children were eligible for enrollment if they presented to 1 of 5 hospitals (3 in Georgia, 2 in Connecticut) with diarrhea of \u226410 days\u2019 duration during January through June 2010 or 2011, and were born after RV1 introduction. Stools were collected; immunization records were obtained from providers and state electronic immunization information system (IIS). Case-subjects (children testing rotavirus antigen-positive) were compared with 2 control groups: children testing rotavirus negative and children selected from IIS. RESULTS: Overall, 165 rotavirus-case subjects and 428 rotavirus-negative controls were enrolled. Using the rotavirus-negative controls, RV1 VE was 91% (95% confidence interval [CI] 80 to 95) and RV5 VE was 92% (CI 75 to 97) among children aged \u22658 months. The RV1 VE against G2P[4] disease was high (94%, CI 78 to 98), as was that against G1P[8] disease (89%, CI 70 to 96). RV1 effectiveness was sustained among children aged 12 through 23 months (VE 91%; CI 75 to 96). VE point estimates using IIS controls were similar to those using rotavirus-negative controls. CONCLUSIONS: RV1 and RV5 were both highly effective against severe rotavirus disease. RV1 conferred sustained protection during the first 2 years of life and demonstrated high effectiveness against G2P[4] (heterotypic) disease.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

This is explained by the fact that agricultural credit is today considered as an important key to the development of the agricultural sector in developing countries. This study examined the factors influencing producers\u2019 access to agricultural credit in Turkey, precisely in the province of Adana. Questionnaire-based surveys were conducted on a sample of 101 producers trained in a simple random. From the analysis of the results obtained, we deduced that socio-economic factors such as the total area of land used, the irrigated area, the ratio between the total share of land used and the total owned land, then the ratio between the number of agricultural assets of the household and the total number household members play a preponderant role in the access of producers to agricultural credit. Since agricultural credit is perceived as an important lever in terms of the development of the agricultural sector in Turkey; it is therefore imperative, based on these research results, to develop policies aiming to improve producers\u2019 access to agricultural credit.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Obstetrics and Gynecology\", \"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging\", \"Reproductive Medicine\", \"Radiological and Ultrasound Technology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [64, 0, 0], "string": "title={P03.14: Early diagnosis of fetal atrioventricular septal defects}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"History\", \"Cultural Studies\"]", "language": "en", "length": [59, 27, 508], "string": "title={Cities without Cavities: Democracy, Risk, and Public Health}, container_title={Journal of Canadian Studies}, abstract={This essay examines the history of fluoride debates in four Canadian cities.

analysis}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Background \u2018Preconception health\u2019 or \u2018pre-pregnancy health\u2019 are terms used to describe the health status of males and females prior to pregnancy. The goal of preconception health strategies is to optimise the health of future offspring via improved parental health, which may result from planned/unplanned pregnancies. Greater emphasis is being placed upon preconception health amongst research and public health, yet there is limited evidence on this topic from the perspective of UK adults. This research explored beliefs, knowledge and attitudes on preconception health amongst adults of childbearing age, drawn from the UK. Methods A descriptive qualitative focus group study was undertaken with healthy males and females of childbearing age (18\u201345 years) between October 2018 and July 2019. Two groups were held in a rural location (one focus group, one mini focus group) and three groups held in an urban location (two focus groups, one mini focus group), with a range of males and females, with and without children. A semi-structured topic guide was devised based on previous literature. All groups were conducted with two researchers trained in qualitative research methods. Focus groups explored understanding/prior knowledge of preconception health, beliefs and attitudes towards preconception healthcare support and personal health. Focus groups were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. Results Twenty-one males and females of childbearing age (aged 18 to 45 years) participated in the research. Discussions revealed a lack of comprehensive awareness of the importance of preconception health and a sense of reluctance to visit a doctor regarding the issue, favouring the internet, unless having problems conceiving. Five themes identified included: preconception education, preconception awareness, wider knowledge networks/support, optimal parental health, and attitudes/emotions towards preconception health. The roles of males regarding positive preconception care was not well understood. Conclusions This study highlighted a lack of detailed awareness surrounding the importance of preconception health per se, despite general agreement that health status should be optimal at this time. It identified a willingness to learn more about preconception health, creating an opportunity to improve preconception healthcare awareness via evidence-based education, social media campaigns, and within healthcare systems in a life course approach.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

inhibition of the binding of 125I-labelled epidermal growth factor (125I-EGF) to Swiss 3T3 cells. The ability of these secretions to inhibit 125I-EGF binding is closely correlated with the ability to stimulate DNA synthesis in quiescent 3T3 cell cultures, suggesting that goat mammary secretions may contain an EGF-related mitogen. However, the material in colostrum which inhibits 125I-EGF binding to Swiss 3T3 cells is a basic protein with Mr greater than 20000 and is thus quite different from mouse and human EGF. Furthermore, the colostral-mediated inhibition of 125I-EGF binding, although rapid and apparently competitive, differs from the inhibition of binding induced by native, unlabelled EGF. Thus, the inhibitory effect of colostrum is markedly decreased when the assay temperature is shifted from 37 degrees C to 4 degrees C whereas unlabelled EGF is an effective competitive inhibitor at both 37 degrees C and 4 degrees C. Incubation of cells with EGF causes a reduction in cell surface EGF receptors whereas exposure to colostrum does not induce down-regulation of the EGF receptor. Our results suggest that the colostral factor does not bind directly to EGF receptors but inhibits 125I-EGF binding by an indirect mechanism which involves a temperature-sensitive step.}",

consequences of short sleep are well-documented, but recent evidence indicates that night-to-night consistency in sleep may be just as important. For the current work, we developed an intraindividual variability in sleep (IIV) questionnaire to make IIV measurement possible in single-time-point studies. We investigated whether self-reported IIV explained unique variance in sleep quality and health beyond average total sleep time (TST), focusing on a critical transition period (first semester of college) in which high variability was predicted. Methods First-semester college students (N=126, Mage=18.28, 75.40% females) completed an IIV questionnaire in which participants indicated their average sleep duration, then estimated how much their sleep duration deviated from their average duration for each day of a typical week. We quantified IIV as the mean day-to-day change in sleep. Participants also completed standard questionnaires on global sleep quality, social jetlag, daytime sleepiness, depression, and stress. Results Participants reported substantial IIV in their sleep durations (M=1.77 hours, SD=0.86) that was largely distinguishable from measures of social jetlag (r=.25) and average TST (r=-.18). Patterns of IIV differed across race/ethnicities: in white/Asian students, IIV was strongly associated with social jetlag (r=-.44) whereas in underrepresented minority students, IIV and social jetlag were separate constructs (r=-.03), suggesting that fluctuations in the latter group occur across all days of the week. Greater IIV was associated with significantly worse global sleep quality (r=.24, p=.01), stress (r=.20, p=.03), and depression, r=.20, p=.03). These associations were significant after adjusting for average TST, and only marginally reduced when controlling for social jetlag. Conclusion IIV in sleep/wake patterns can be captured using a questionnaire, and such measurement provides unique explanatory power to understanding sleep quality and mental health. Future research is needed to compare IIV questionnaire data to actigraphy data and to understand the underlying mechanisms by which inconsistent sleep detrimentally affects individuals.

Five ensembles are created, each containing 100 realizations for an idealized \u2018Pinatubo-like\u2019 equatorial volcanic eruption with emissions covering a range of 2.5-40 Tg sulfur (S). The ensembles provide an excellent database to disentangle the influence of volcanic forcing on monsoons and tropical hydroclimate over the wide spectrum of the climate\u2019s internal variability. Monsoons are generally weaker for two years after volcanic eruption and their weakening is a function of emissions. However, only a stronger than Pinatubo-like eruption ( \u2a7e 10 Tg S) leads to significant and substantial monsoon changes, and some regions (such as North and South Africa, South America and South Asia) are much more sensitive to this kind of forcing than the others. The decreased monsoon precipitation is strongly tied to the weakening of the regional tropical overturning. The reduced atmospheric net energy input and increased gross moist stability at the Hadley circulation updraft due to the equatorial volcanic eruption, require a slowdown of the circulation as a consequence of less moist static energy exported away from the intertropical convergence zone.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Developmental and Educational Psychology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [170, 0, 0], "string": "title={Examining the Mediating Role of Mindful Parenting: A Study on the Relationship Between Parental Emotion Regulation Difficulties and Problem Behaviors of Children with ASD}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging\", \"Oncology\", \"Hematology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [87, 0, 0], "string": "title={898 Poster Dosimetric study of prostate templates used for high dose rate brachytherapy}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cell Biology\", \"Molecular Biology\", \"Biochemistry\", \"Biophysics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [157, 0, 700], "string": "title={Insulin pretreatment (imprinting) produces elevated capacity in the insulin binding of Tetrahymena.

This report describes the first case of complete occlusion with targeted TVE using an alternative approach route in a 70-year-old woman presenting with tinnitus diagnosed with dAVF at the JTVC. Case Description: The patient had no history of head trauma or other preexisting conditions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no abnormal findings in the brain parenchyma. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed a dAVF near the ACC. The shunt pouch was located in the JTVC, near the left hypoglossal canal, with feeders from the bilateral ascending pharyngeal arteries and occipital arteries, left meningohypophyseal trunk, and odontoid arch of the left vertebral artery. TVE was performed near the shunt pouch. Localized packing of the shunt point was achieved. The patient\u2019s tinnitus improved. Postoperative MRI showed disappearance of the shunt without any complications. No recurrence was observed on MRA 6 months after treatment. Conclusion: Our results suggest targeted TVE is an effective treatment for dAVFs at the JTVC.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Immunology\", \"Immunology and Allergy\"]", "language": "en", "length": [120, 0, 2134], "string": "title={Association Between Baseline Therapy and Flare Reduction in Mepolizumab-Treated Patients With Hypereosinophilic Syndrome}, container_title={}, abstract={BackgroundCurrent standard-of-care treatments for hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) include oral corticosteroids (OCS) and immunosuppressive/cytotoxic (IS/CT) therapies. The anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody mepolizumab has also recently been approved for patients with this disease. The objective of this analysis was to assess the relationship between baseline therapy and flare reduction in patients with HES treated with mepolizumab, using data from the Phase III 200622 study (NCT02836496).MethodsIn the double-blind, parallel-group 200622 study, eligible patients were \u226512 years old and had HES for \u22656 months, \u22652 flares in the previous 12 months, blood eosinophils \u22651000 cells/\u03bcL at screening and \u22654 weeks\u2019 stable HES therapy. Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive mepolizumab 300 mg subcutaneously or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks plus their existing HES therapy. This post hoc, descriptive analysis assessed the effect of baseline HES therapy [IS/CT (\u00b1 OCS), OCS No IS/CT, and No IS/CT/OCS] on the proportion of patients with \u22651 flare during the study period, the annualised rate of flares, time to first flare, and the proportion of patients with \u22651 flare during Weeks 20\u250032, with mepolizumab versus placebo.ResultsMepolizumab treatment was associated with a decrease in the proportion of patients who experienced \u22651 flare during the study period in all baseline therapy groups versus placebo (32\u201396% reduction). Similarly, the probability of a flare was lower with mepolizumab (14.3\u201331.4%) than placebo (35.7\u201374.1%) in all baseline therapy groups, as was the annualised flare rate (0.22\u20130.68 vs 1.14\u20131.62). The proportion of patients who experienced \u22651 flare during Weeks 20\u201332 was reduced with mepolizumab versus placebo for all baseline therapy groups (55\u201385% reduction). For all endpoints, the greatest effect of mepolizumab treatment was seen in the IS/CT (\u00b1 OCS) group.ConclusionsPatients with poorly controlled HES are likely to achieve clinical benefit with mepolizumab in terms of flare reduction, regardless of their baseline therapy.Clinical Trial Registration(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02836496).}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Ecology\", \"Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology\", \"Food Science\", \"Biotechnology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [162, 0, 210], "string": "title={Moderate High-Pressure Superdormancy in Bacillus Spores: Properties of Superdormant Spores and Proteins Potentially Influencing Moderate High-Pressure Germination}, container_title={}, abstract={Spore-forming bacteria are ubiquitous in nature and, as a consequence, inevitably enter the food chain or other processing environments.

Methods: Data from the 2018 Casablanca Travel Survey show that overall, women are less mobile than men, make fewer work-related trips and more household maintenance trips, but these differences are heterogeneously distributed across income groups. With the increase in income, women tend to carry out more trips than men; the inverse is observed for the middle- and low-income categories. Results: While for the lowest income groups, walking is the most predominant mode for both men and women, we notice that the private car has the highest modal share within the highest income groups as with the increase in household income, both genders avoid non-motorized transport modes. The particular status of women in some households as breadwinners and reproducers as well as the socio-cultural context of the city shape their mobility and the choice of their activities. Conclusion: Hence, these findings suggest, from a policy perspective, that the public transit system along with spatial planning strategies need to be improved to help overcome women's mobility constraints, especially when they belong to low-income households so they can fully access the city amenities and opportunities. On the other hand, transport policies need to be not only gender-sensitive but also \u201cvulnerable groups\u201d sensitive as mobility impediments are similarly experienced by males and females in

abstract={AbstractBoth elevated and depressed testosterone (T) levels have been reported in Crohn's disease (CD). In this pilot study, effects of T administration on CD were assessed.A total of 13 men with CD, aged 45\u201367 years, had subnormal plasma T (mean\u00b1SD=9.0\u00b11.4 nmol/L) (reference >12.0); they were compared to a group of 110 men of similar age with sexual and urological problems whose plasma T was also subnormal: 10.4\u00b11.4 nmol/L (p=0.02). All received treatment with parenteral T undecanoate for 24 months. The Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) was assessed as an indicator of the severity of the disease every 3 months. Levels of T and C-reactive protein (CRP) were compared between the 13 men with CD and the other men in this study. Values of CDAI and CRP were followed-up.CRP levels were 22.7 mg/dL (95% confidence interval of the mean: 14.9\u201334.3) in the 13 men with CD vs. 3.5 (2.9\u20134.1) in 107 control men (p=0.001). Upon normalization of serum T, there was a significant decline of CDAI (from 243\u00b119 to 89\u00b19), CRP levels from 22.7\u00b18.1 to 6.9\u00b12.9 mg/dL, and white blood cell count. Hemoglobin/hematocrit increased significantly.Upon normalization of plasma T the CDAI and CRP levels decreased in hypogonadal patients with CD. The mechanism of this improvement could be through immunosuppressive effects of T, reducing chronic inflammation of the intestinal wall in CD.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [72, 0, 0], "string": "title={Feasibility of concomitant MitraClip and left atrial appendage occlusion}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Nephrology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [35, 0, 0], "string": "title={The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemic}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Infectious Diseases\", \"Microbiology (medical)\"]", "language": "en", "length": [108, 0, 0], "string": "title={Rapid diagnosis of amoebic liver abscess using recombinant Entamoeba histolytica pyruvate phosphate dikinase}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Computer Science Applications\", \"Environmental Engineering\"]", "language": "en", "length": [88, 0, 824], "string": "title={Big Five Personality Prediction from Social Media Data using Machine Learning Techniques}, container_title={}, abstract={Personality has been important for a number of types of cooperation;

Crisis es un t\u00e9rmino que da cuenta de alguna dificultad en las din\u00e1micas sociales de los pa\u00edses. Por esta raz\u00f3n, se plantea la idea de crisis del sistema mundo para explicar todas las alteraciones sociales que surgen a partir de situaciones que no pueden resolverse hasta que intervengan otros factores externos. Por qu\u00e9 la crisis y en qu\u00e9 consiste la crisis: econ\u00f3micas (devaluaci\u00f3n de la moneda, incremento de precios de los combustibles, desempleo y bajas remuneraciones), pol\u00edticas (bloqueos internacionales, desconfianza en los partidos pol\u00edticos y quiebres de las democracias), \u00e9ticas (antivalores, anomia y corrupci\u00f3n) y ecol\u00f3gicas (desastres naturales por efectos del cambio clim\u00e1tico y desplazados ambientales); constituyen aspectos que en el presente trabajo vamos a analizar con relaci\u00f3n a uno de los mayores problemas hoy: el fen\u00f3meno de la migraci\u00f3n transnacional.

En las siguientes p\u00e1ginas examinamos el problema de la crisis del sistema mundo, luego, analizamos los efectos de la crisis en la migraci\u00f3n y, finalmente, reflexionamos sobre la relaci\u00f3n de la crisis y el fen\u00f3meno migratorio. Para ello, analizamos los aportes sobre el problema de la crisis del sistema mundo de Inmanuelle Wallerstein y sobre la crisis del patr\u00f3n de poder colonial moderno eurocentrado de An\u00edbal Quijano. Consideramos estas dos propuestas te\u00f3ricas por ser las de mayor repercusi\u00f3n en el mundo. Asimismo, examinamos los aportes al tema de la crisis de C\u00e9sar German\u00e1 y Alain Touraine.

data scarcity, the soil properties of the Colombian \u201cPiedemonte Llanero\u201d are poorly quantified. To provide basic information about how pedogenic properties along a steeply sloped and perhumid landscape are related to its use (which can help lead toward better management and establishment of a sustainable crop production system), this work addresses the characterization of the morphogenetic and chemical features of selected Piedemonte Llanero soils. Research was conducted in a sequence of soils composed of four profiles located in a transect of 200\u20131800 m of altitude. After macromorphologically identifying, describing, and analyzing soils based on these data, soil weathering and general fertility were interpreted. Ultisols, Inceptisols, Entisols and Oxisols were fundamentally identified according to Soil Taxonomy; that is, Lixisols, Cambisols, Umbrisols, and Ferralsols, according to IUSS Working Group WRB (2015). The dominant effect of humidity attributes in soil formation, with slope and slope gradients, was the major controlling factor for the contrasting soil genesis and properties along the watershed sequence. The acid character, low cation exchange capacity, and degree of saturation stood out, and, including the inherent increase in Al3+ of change, were the most outstanding characters. The data obtained by this study present a substantial basis for good land use planning and will facilitate technology to be transferred from one area to another with a similar environmental picture.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Algebra and Number Theory\"]", "language": "en", "length": [80, 0, 0], "string": "title={Leonard Pairs and Leonard Triples ofq-Racah Type from the Quantum AlgebraUq(sl2)}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [205, 31, 0], "string": "title={Strains of Mesorhizobium amorphae and Mesorhizobium tianshanense, carrying symbiotic genes of common chickpea endosymbiotic species, constitute a novel biovar (ciceri) capable of nodulating Cicer arietinum}, container_title={Letters in Applied Microbiology}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"History\", \"Cultural Studies\"]", "language": "es", "length": [192, 0, 0], "string": "title={Las mujeres en la construcci\u00f3n de las sociedades iberoamericanas.

Let\u2019s GO PO: Impact of Monthly Feedback on a Longitudinal Intravenous to Oral Antimicrobial Conversion Initiative}, container_title={Open Forum Infectious Diseases}, abstract={Abstract Background Timely conversion of antimicrobials from intravenous (IV) to oral (PO) route has been shown to decrease costs and length of stay (LOS) without compromising safety and efficacy of therapy. Use of oral antimicrobials may additionally prevent complications related to IV catheters, such as infection, emboli, and patient discomfort. An approved IV to PO policy allowed pharmacists to convert orders for fourteen included antimicrobials and eligible patients at time of order verification. Methods This single-center, retrospective, comparative study was conducted at AdventHealth Orlando, a 1,368-bed community teaching hospital in central Florida. In November 2020, six clinical pharmacist teams began receiving monthly feedback on IV to PO conversion rates in the form of a RePOrt Card, containing IV to PO conversion rates compared to other clinical teams, individual antimicrobial conversion rates, and comparison to prior team progress (Figure 1). RePOrt Cards were provided through October 2021. This study compared pre-intervention days of therapy (DOTs) of antimicrobials from November 2019-October 2020 to post-intervention DOTs from November 2020 to March 2022. The primary objective of this study was to assess the impact of monthly, team-based feedback on percentage of antimicrobials administered orally during a pharmacist-driven IV to PO stewardship initiative. Figure 1Example RePOrt Card Results Significantly more DOTs were administered orally in the post intervention group (62% vs 67%, p=0.0012). Positive change in oral conversion rates was observed for all agents except linezolid, minocycline, and voriconazole (Table 1). The largest increase in percentage of DOT administered orally was observed for azithromycin (20%), rifampin (14%), and metronidazole (10%). Estimated monthly and total cost differences are available in Table 2. Minocycline represents the largest opportunity missed; while oral conversion rates remained the same, an increase in overall drug use creates opportunity to continue to prioritize oral conversion due to high cost. Conclusion Monthly, team-based feedback positively impacted IV to PO conversion rates. Opportunities remain to optimize cost benefits in high-cost agents such as linezolid, minocycline, and voriconazole. Disclosures Amy L.

The equilibrium contact angle of Ni-Al alloys on TiC x (X = 0.7-1) vs. Ni content showed that the wetting angle depends on the concentration of C in TiC x. The results agreed with the observation of morphology at the interfaces between the hard phase skeleton of TiC x (x = 0.7, 0.9) and metallic phases. The concentration distance plot for Ti , and Ni across the interface of Ni 3 Al/TiC 0.7 showed that an extensive area of intermetallic compounds can be observed at the Ni 3 Al/TiC 0.7 interface. The microstructure analysis suggested that Ti in TiC 0.7 is easier to dissolve into the molten alloy than that in TiC 0.9. Some periodic zigzag fringes were also observed in the interface between metallic phase and carbides in the sample of Ni 3 Al/TiC 0.7. The formation of this periodic zigzag fringe, which may be a growth zone of a new Ti-Ni-Al phase, would occur during the initial stage of solidification in the samples obtained by infiltration.

have argued that a promising approach to treatment was prematurely abandoned in the 1960s primarily because of Richard Nixon's \u2018War on Drugs\u2019.This paper (1) briefly describes research in the 1950s and 1960s in North America on the use of LSD to treat alcohol dependence, anxiety in terminal illness, and anxiety and depression; and (2) discusses the factors that led to its abandonment.MethodAn analysis of historical scholarship on psychedelic research in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s in North America.ResultsResearch on psychedelic drugs in psychiatry was abandoned for a number of reasons that acted in concert. A major factor was that clinical research on psychedelic drugs was caught up in the tighter regulation of pharmaceutical research after the Thalidomide disaster in 1963. Psychedelic drugs also presented special challenges for randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials in the 1970s that were not as positive as the claims made by their advocates in the 1950s and 1960s. Clinical research became more difficult after 1965 when Sandoz ceased providing psychedelic drugs for research and their nonmedical use was prohibited in 1970.ConclusionsThe demise of psychedelic drug research was not solely due to the \u2018War on Drugs\u2019. It was hastened by tighter regulation of pharmaceutical research, the failure of controlled clinical trials to live up to the claims of psychedelic advocates, and the pharmaceutical industry's lack of interest in funding clinical trials.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Nephrology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [78, 0, 0], "string": "title={Predictors of outcome for severe IgA Nephropathy in a multi-ethnic U.S. cohort}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [107, 0, 0], "string": "title={Reproductive Ecology of Picea Mariana (Mill.)

Null alleles of either the recB or the recC genes, which encode the B and C subunits, respectively, manifest no recombination and none of the nuclease functions characteristic of the holoenzyme. Loss of the D subunit, by a recD mutation, likewise results in loss of ExoV activity. However, mutants lacking the D subunit are competent for homologous recombination. We report that the distribution of exchanges along the chromosome of Red\u2212Gam\u2212phage \u03bb is strikingly altered by recD null mutations in the host. When \u03bb DNA replication is blocked, recombination in recD mutant strains is high near \u03bb's right end. In contrast, recombination in isogenic recD+ strains is approximately uniform along \u03bb unless the \u03bb chromosome contains a \u03c7 sequence. Recombination in recD mutant strains is focused toward the site of action of a type II restriction enzyme acting in vivo on \u03bb. The distribution of exchanges in isogenic recD+ strains is scarcely altered by the restriction enzyme (unless the phage contains an otherwise silent \u03c7). The distribution of exchanges in recD mutants is strongly affected by \u03bb DNA replication. The distribution of exchanges on \u03bb growing in rec+ cells is not influenced by DNA replication. The exchange distribution along \u03bb in recD mutant cells is independent of \u03c7 in a variety of conditions. Recombination in rec+ cells is \u03c7 influenced. Recombination in recD mutants depends on recC function, occurs in strains deleted for rac prophage, and is independent of recJ, which is known to be required for \u03bb recombination via the RecF pathway. We entertain two models for recombination in recD mutants: (i) recombination in recD mutants may proceed via double-chain break\u2013repair, as it does in \u03bb's Red pathway and E. coli's RecE pathway; (ii) the RecBC enzyme, missing its D subunit, is equivalent to the wild-type, RecBCD, enzyme after that enzyme has been activated by a \u03c7 sequence.Key words: \u03c7 sequence, RecBCD pathway, Red pathway, RecBC\u2021 pathway.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cell Biology\", \"Molecular Biology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [105, 0, 0], "string": "title={Chromosomal Association of the Smc5/6 Complex Reveals that It Functions in Differently Regulated Pathways}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Rehabilitation\", \"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine\", \"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation\", \"Complementary and Manual Therapy\"]", "language": "en", "length": [94, 25, 1552], "string": "title={Scheduling, waiting time, absenteeism and repressed demand in outpatient physical therapy care}, container_title={Fisioterapia em Movimento}, abstract={Abstract Introduction: Access to physiotherapy services needs to be timely, avoiding the establishment of disabilities in users. Analyzing the demands in physiotherapy provides a basis for planning both the management of queues and preventive actions and the reorganization of services, directing them to the main needs of the public. Objective: To identify users who needed outpatient physiotherapy services in the Unified Health System (SUS) in Campo Grande/MS and to characterize those cared for and repressed demand, as well as analyzing absenteeism and the waiting time for access. Methods: We used secondary data from the Vacancy Regulation System and performed association and multivariate analyses, with a significance level of 5%. Results: Females were predominant and their number increased year by year; the largest number of requests was for adult motor disorders. The average waiting time in the period (2017-2019) was approximately 2.5 months. Absenteeism was 34% and increased yearly. Most appointments and absenteeism were from users from the region of greatest social exclusion. Most referrals of repressed demand were for primary care and for physical therapy treatment in adult motor disorders. Conclusion: The results showed excessive waiting time between the request and the scheduling, high rates of absenteeism and repressed demand.

Previous studies, all in Sigma, had shown that the adhesion phenotype was controlled by the filamentation mitogen-activated kinase (fMAPK) pathway, which activates a set of transcription factors required for the transcription of the structural gene FLO11. Unexpectedly, the fMAPK pathway is not required for FLO11 transcription in S288c despite the fact that the fMAPK genes are present and active in other pathways. Using transformation and a sensitized reporter, it was possible to isolate RPI1, one of the modifiers that permits the bypass of the fMAPK pathway in S288c. RPI1 encodes a transcription factor with allelic differences between the two strains: The RPI1 allele from S288c but not the one from Sigma can confer fMAPK pathway-independent transcription of FLO11.

Many wheat flour proteins also present dietary problems for consumers with celiac disease or wheat allergies. Despite the importance of these proteins it has been particularly challenging to use MS/MS to distinguish the many proteins in a flour sample and relate them to gene sequences. Results Grain from the extensively characterized spring wheat cultivar Triticum aestivum 'Butte 86' was milled to white flour from which proteins were extracted, then separated and quantified by 2-DE. Protein spots were identified by separate digestions with three proteases, followed by tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the peptides. The spectra were used to interrogate an improved protein sequence database and results were integrated using the Scaffold program. Inclusion of cultivar specific sequences in the database greatly improved the results, and 233 spots were identified, accounting for 93.1% of normalized spot volume. Identified proteins were assigned to 157 wheat sequences, many for proteins unique to wheat and nearly 40% from Butte 86. Alpha-gliadins accounted for 20.4% of flour protein, low molecular weight glutenin subunits 18.0%, high molecular weight glutenin subunits 17.1%, gamma-gliadins 12.2%, omega-gliadins 10.5%, amylase/protease inhibitors 4.1%, triticins 1.6%, serpins 1.6%, purinins 0.9%, farinins 0.8%, beta-amylase 0.5%, globulins 0.4%, other enzymes and factors 1.9%, and all other 3%. Conclusions This is the first successful effort to identify the majority of abundant flour proteins for a single wheat cultivar, relate them to individual gene sequences and estimate their relative levels. Many genes for wheat flour proteins are not expressed, so this study represents further progress in describing the expressed wheat genome. Use of cultivar-specific contigs helped to overcome the difficulties of matching peptides to gene sequences for members of highly similar, rapidly evolving storage protein families. Prospects for simplifying this process for routine analyses are discussed. The ability to measure expression levels for individual flour protein genes complements information gained from efforts to sequence the wheat genome and is essential for studies of effects of environment on gene expression.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law\", \"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment\", \"Geography, Planning and Development\"]", "language": "en", "length": [113, 0, 1700], "string": "title={A Comprehensive Post Evaluation of the Implementation of Water-Saving Measures in Xiangtan, Hunan Province, China}, container_title={}, abstract={Water resource is an important foundation to support industrial and agricultural production, in the maintenance of national energy security role is irreplaceable. Water conservation and the effective use of water resources are essential for achieving sustainable development in China. The construction of water-saving society is a prerequisite for realizing efficient utilization of water resources and an important strategic development for moving towards environment-friendly society. This study established an index system to evaluate the implementation of water-saving measures in Xiangtan, Hunan province, China. The index system incorporated five aspects: (1) comprehensiveness; (2) agricultural water; (3) industrial water; (4) domestic water, and; (5) aquatic ecology and environmental management. Analytic hierarchy (AH) was used to determine the weights of indices, and AH was integrated with grey relative analysis to establish a comprehensive system for the evaluation of the water-saving measures in Xiangtan. The results showed that the implementation of water-saving measures in Xiangtan is generally progressing well. However, industrial added value water consumption per 10,000-yuan remains at the primary stage and wastewater reuse remains limited. In addition, water use per 10,000-yuan gross domestic product, the coverage of water-saving irrigation projects, industrial wastewater reuse, and the leakage rate of urban water supply network remain at an intermediate stage.

However, there is still uncertainty about the balance between efficacy and safety of LMWHs in elderly subjects with impaired renal function (usually excluded from clinical trials). Pharmacokinetics of tinzaparin suggest it shows less accumulation in impaired renal function than other LMWHs. The IRIS (innohep\u00ae in renal insufficiency study) was an international, multicentre, open, centrally randomised, parallel group study in elderly patients \u226575 years with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of \u226460 ml/min, or \u226570 years with a CrCl of \u226430 ml/min and who had suffered an acute symptomatic objectively confirmed lower limb DVT (+/\u2212 acute PE) within 48 hours prior to randomisation. Patients were randomised to tinzaparin 175 IU/kg subcutaneously OD or aPTT titrated heparin given subcutaneously BD for at least 5 days and until INR is between 2 \u2013 3 on 2 consecutive days. After the acute management both groups received oral anticoagulation with coumarins to day 90. The primary endpoint was clinically relevant bleeds (CRB) by day 90, secondary endpoints included recurrence of VTE and death. All endpoints were centrally adjudicated blindly. After a planned interim analysis, Data Monitoring Committee advised the premature stopping with 542 patients enrolled. At that time 350 patients had completed follow up and mortality rates were 5% for heparin and 13% for tinzaparin. The full analysis set of 537 patients were followed to day 90 when mortality rates were 6.3% vs 11.2% for heparin and tinzaparin respectively (p=0.049). The difference in mortality was not due to recurrent VTE or bleeding. The Kaplan Meier mortality curves for the overall population diverged on average 20 days after heparin/tinzaparin had been discontinued. Most of the difference in mortality was in those aged 90 years and above (9.4% vs 30.8%). Below 90 the mortality rates were 5.9% vs 7.8% respectively. Bleedings: The rate of CRB was 11.9% in both groups over 90 days and was also equal in both groups (7.1%) for the first 12 days. During the initial 12 days for those with a CrCl &lt;30 ml/min, 11.8% had a CRB in the heparin group and 10.0% with tinzaparin. Over both the initial 12 day and complete 90 day follow up periods there were no significant differences in the rate of major bleeds between the heparin and tinzaparin treated patients nor between those with a CrCl of above or below 30 ml/min. The rate of recurrent VTE was 1.1% for heparin vs 2.6% for tinzaparin (p=0.203) and adverse drug reactions occurred in 22.3% vs 16.3% respectively. A review of risk factors suggested an imbalance at randomisation, a higher percentage of the tinzaparin group having: ongoing malignancy, infectious disease, cardiac insufficiency, immobility, age &gt;90 years. A multivariate statistical analysis showed no difference between the two treatments, but suggested the presence of infectious disease, ongoing malignancy, cardiac insufficiency or age &gt;90 were more correlated with mortality than treatment group. The possible difference in mortality, particularly in patients &gt;90 remains to be explained and play of chance cannot be excluded. Conclusions: This pioneering study showed that in elderly subjects aged up to 90, with significant renal insufficiency, there was no hint of an excess bleeding associated with unadjusted Tinzaparin. Whether there is a real difference between unfractionated heparin and tinzaparin in terms of VTE or mortality in the elderly remains to be confirmed.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Law\"]", "language": "en", "length": [47, 0, 0], "string": "title={Review \u2014 infotech on computer audit and control}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Social Psychology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [85, 0, 0], "string": "title={From making to being the excuse: An analysis of deception and verbal/nonverbal issues}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Instrumentation\"]", "language": "en", "length": [131, 0, 0], "string": "title={An accurate method for the refractive index measurements of liquids: Application of the Kramers\u2013Kronig relation in the liquid phase}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Organic Chemistry\", \"Drug Discovery\", \"Biochemistry\"]", "language": "en", "length": [123, 19, 0], "string": "title={Transannular Diels-Alder reaction of 14-membered macrocyclic trienes.

expansion for the Adler function, which simultaneously implements renormalisation-group summation and has a tamed large-order behaviour. The new expansion functions, which replace the standard powers of the coupling, are singular at the origin of the coupling plane and have divergent perturbative expansions, resembling the expanded function itself. Confronting the new perturbative expansions with the standard ones on specific models investigated recently in the literature, I show that they approximate in an impressive way the exact Adler function and the spectral function moments.

to 12 months after total thyroidectomy and to determine the clinical value of the calcium levels on hospital discharge. Summary of background data: Thyroid surgeries are among the most common operations performed in the world. Hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy is a common complication that is sometimes difficult to correct. Methods: From January 2015 through April 2017, 400 patients were included in this prospective multicenter study. All the patients underwent total thyroidectomy. By way of random of selection, 2 groups of patients were formed: 30 patients who had a normal level of calcium detected in the blood on discharge from the hospital after total thyroidectomy (normocalcemia group), and 30 patients who had a reduced level of calcium in the blood on discharge from the hospital (hypocalcemia group). In these groups of patients, various parameters were determined. Results: The comparison of patient groups with normocalcemia and hypocalcemia on discharge from the hospital and 6 to 12 months after surgery demonstrated that there were no statistically significant factors for postoperative hypocalcemia. Generally, there were no differences between the groups 6 to 12 months after surgery. Conclusions: Treatment with calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D preparations after surgery leads to disappearance of both biochemical and clinical expression of hypocalcemia in most cases. On discharge from the hospital, patients with more pronounced hypocalcemia should be administered calcium and calcitriol preparations, even in the absence of clinical symptoms.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Strategy and Management\", \"Sociology and Political Science\", \"Industrial Relations\", \"Business and International Management\"]", "language": "en", "length": [0, 0, 0], "string": "title={}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Polymers and Plastics\", \"Biomaterials\"]", "language": "en", "length": [106, 0, 0], "string": "title={Adhesives produced by reaction of hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene with phenols, bisphenols and benzilic acid}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Inorganic Chemistry\"]", "language": "de", "length": [163, 0, 0], "string": "title={Photoelektronenspektroskopische Untersuchung der intramolekularen \u03c0,\u03c0\u2010Wechselwirkungen in endo \u2010Tricyclo[4.2.1.0 2,5 ]\u2010nonadienen.

Design: This was a qualitative descriptive study. Methods: Nursing students who attended the 2008 and 2009 conferences of the American Holistic Nurses Association interviewed expert holistic nurses, asking them for advice for beginners. Students recorded the interviews on paper and wrote their perceptions of interacting with experts. The data were examined for recurring themes. Findings: The most common advice from the experts was regarding the importance of self-care, person-centered care, touch, and lifelong learning. Students\u2019 perceptions of the interviews included feeling empowered to accomplish goals, gaining a greater understanding of holistic nursing, and feeling admiration for the holistic nurse experts. Conclusion: Giving students the opportunity to interact with nurse experts in an individual, informal setting is a useful educational strategy that increases knowledge, promotes socialization to the

This allows us to model different types of dependencies as supports and attacks. Previous studies provided a translation from Normal Logic Programs (NLPs) toADFs and proved the stable models semantics for a normal logic program has an equivalent semantics to that of the correspondingADF. However, these studies failed in identifying a semantics forADFs equivalent to a three-valued semantics (as partial stable models and well-founded models) forNLPs. In this work, we focus on a fragment ofADFs, called Attacking Dialectical Frameworks (ADF+s), and provide a translation fromNLPs toADF+s robust enough to guarantee the equivalence between partial stable models, well-founded models, regular models, stable models semantics forNLPs and respectively complete models, grounded models, preferred models, stable models forADFs. In addition, we define a new semantics forADF+s, calledL-stable, and show it is equivalent to theL-stable semantics forNLPs.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

(NA) complexes to leaves, pollen, and developing seeds and play an important role in regulating iron (Fe) accumulation during the seed development and maturation stages; however, how their gene transcript levels are regulated remains unknown. In this study, we used yeast one-hybrid screening to identify a transcription factor, WRKY12, in Arabidopsis that directly regulates the transcription levels of YSL1 and YSL3 genes. WRKY12 has opposite expression patterns to YSL1 and YSL3. wrky12 mutants are tolerant to Fe deficiency, whereas WRKY12 overexpression lines are sensitive to Fe deficiency. During the development and maturation of seeds, WRKY12 can directly bind to the promoters of YSL1 and YSL3 and inhibit their expression. Genetic analysis showed that WRKY12 functions upstream of YSL1 and YSL3 in Fe intake during the seed development and maturation stages. Together, our results suggest that WRKY12 negatively regulates the iron intake in plant seeds by inhibiting the expression of YSL1 and YSL3.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0,

Bacterial vs viral etiology of fever: a prospective study to estimate a host score\u2019s potential to support ED physicians' etiologic accuracy}, container_title={Open Forum Infectious Diseases}, abstract={Abstract Background A host-protein score (BV) combining the circulating levels of TRAIL, IP-10 and CRP was developed for distinguishing bacterial from viral infection. BV\u2019s potential to impact decision making at the emergency department (ED) was assessed by comparing BV to physician\u2019s etiological suspicion. Methods Rosetta study participants, aged 3 months to 18 years with febrile respiratory tract infection or fever without source, were prospectively recruited in a tertiary care pediatric ED. The main eligibility criteria were symptoms for less than 7 days and immunocompetence. ED physician\u2019s initial etiological suspicion (bacterial/viral/I don\u2019t know) and degree of confidence (low/medium/high) were recorded in a questionnaire. BV was interpreted based on pre-defined score thresholds (viral/bacterial/equivocal); the results were not available to the physician. The etiologic reference standard was based on the diagnoses (bacterial/viral/indeterminate) of 3 independent pediatricians who were provided with all available patient data but blinded to BV. BV\u2019s potential to impact the physician\u2019s etiologic accuracy was estimated according to alignment between BV and etiological suspicion as filled in the questionnaire (assuming full adoption of BV by the physician). Results Among 348 patients recruited, 290 met eligibility criteria and had requisite serum sample (Figure 1A). Median age was 1.3 years (interquartile range 1.7), 37.5% were female. 211 patients had questionnaires filled. BV matched physician\u2019s label and reference standard in 72% of the cases (151/211; Figure 1B); of these, 52% (78/151) were labeled by the physician with low/medium confidence, i.e., BV could reinforce the physician\u2019s suspicion. In 12% of the cases (26/211) BV aligned with the reference standard but not with the physician\u2019s suspicion, and therefore could correct the physician's etiologic diagnosis. BV did not align with the reference standard in 7% of the cases (14/211) and was equivocal in 9% of the cases (20/211). Overall, BV could potentially correct physician diagnosis and reduce error &gt;2-fold, from 16.1% to 8.1%. Figure 1.Assessing the potential impact of BV on ED physician\u2019s etiologic accuracy. (A) Reference standard outcomes and BV scores. (B) BV versus adjudication-based reference standard and ED physician etiologic suspicion. Cases with missing questionnaire were omitted; n=211. Conclusion BV has potential to aid the diagnostic process. Future studies are warranted to assess the real-world impact of BV on ED practice.
