a few studies focusing on parasites. In this study, saddleback (Saguinus fuscicollis) and moustached tamarin (Saguinus mystax) from the rainforest of the Peruvian lowlands were used as models to determine helminth parasite associations between canopy-dwelling primate species and a nearby human settlement. The human population showed high prevalences of infestation with a number of nematodes, including Ascaris lumbricoides (88\u00b79%), Trichuris trichiura (37%) and hookworms (55\u00b76%). However, the ova of these geohelminths were not detectable in tamarin faeces. Thus, no direct parasite transfer from humans to non-human primates could be documented. However, tamarin groups with more frequent contact to humans and their facilities had significantly higher prevalences and egg output of Prosthenorchis elegans, an important primate pathogen, than a forest group. In contrast, a cestode was significantly more common with more egg output in sylvatic than in human-associated groups. Human alteration of the habitat is likely to play a major role in determining the occurrence, prevalence and intensity of helminth infestation of wild non-human primates.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0,

microenvironment in NSCLC}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has improved outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in patients with high tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Identifying the pharmacodynamic (PD) impact of ICI on immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) can inform therapeutic development for patients with progressive disease. We sought to identify PD changes in the TME from patients before and after ICI therapy using a spatial transcriptomics platform that allows highly multiplexed profiling of 1,800 genes (Nanostring Digital Spatial Profiler [DSP]). Methods: Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue from 22 patients was sourced commercially. Patients were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, then underwent a surgical tumor resection. After surgery an adjuvant chemotherapy was administered until progression; patients then received monotherapy ICI (nivolumab or pembrolizumab). Once progressed on ICI, another resection was performed. Patients were then treated with chemotherapy and followed until progression and/or death. The DSP technology was used to independently profile RNA from PanCK+ (tumor) and PanCK- (stroma) regions in the tissue based on fluorescence staining. Six circular regions of 600\u03bcm in diameter were selected for analysis using the GeoMx instrument; each area contained CD3+ cells. Additionally, immunohistochemistry for PDL1 and CD3 was performed, images were scored by a pathologist and analyzed with digital pathology algorithms. Results: Spatial transcriptomic analysis of pre- vs post-ICI treatment in stroma revealed significant increases in T cell genes (CD3E, TCRB, NKG7), T-cell activation markers (CD69, IFNG, OX40, GZMB, ICOS), costimulatory signaling (CD28, CD80, CD86), and immune checkpoints (CTLA4, TIGIT). Ayers et al., JCI 2017 identified 28 genes predictive of ICI response, 12 were significantly upregulated in the stroma post-ICI (26 were present in the DSP panel). We identified genes in the pre-ICI stromal microenvironment that were highly expressed in patients with partial response to ICI, the most significant genes were involved in immune regulation (IFIT1) and extracellular matrix remodeling (MMP3). In contrast, stromal genes highly expressed in patients with progressive disease were associated with T-cell maintenance (ETS1, IL7R, CCL19). Conclusions: In this study we used spatial transcriptomics to profile tissue regions where T-cells were in close proximity to tumor cells (microns). This focused, local PD analysis confirmed activated T-cells are present post-ICI. Ongoing studies in a larger cohort will be used to identify tumoral mechanisms of resistance and immune dysfunction to inform future therapeutics and combinations.

Radiofrequency (RF-) assisted liver resection devices like the Habib sealer induce a necrotic resection plane from which a small margin of necrotic liver tissue remains in situ. The aim of the present paper was to report our long-time experience with the new resection method and the morphological characteristics of the remaining necrotic resection plane. Methods. 64 RF-assisted liver resections were performed using the Habib sealer. Followup was assessed at defined time points. Results. The postoperative mortality was 3,6% and morbidity was 18%. The followup revealed that the necrotic zone was detectable in all analyzed CT and MRI images as a hypodense structure without any contrast enhancement at all time points, irrespectively of the time interval between resection and examination. Conclusion. Liver resection utilizing radiofrequency-induced resection plane coagulation is a safe alternative to the established resection techniques. The residual zone of coagulation necrosis remains basically unchanged during a followup of three years. This has to be kept in mind when evaluating the follow up imaging of these patients.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

TMP, softwood CTMP and hardwood CTMP), which were refined at varying intensity. Resulting pulp properties have been compared with high consistency refining (HCR) of the same reject pulps. For all furnish types, it was shown that LCR can develop pulp properties matching those developed through HCR with significantly less energy. The resulting pulp properties were found to be affected not only by refining intensity and energy, but also by initial fibre morphology. Pilot LCR trials demonstrated that high freeness reject pulp is initially insensitive to refining intensity as specific energy is applied.

Voter turnout has steadily declined from its 1960 peak of 63%, and the presidential election of 1996 was the first in the lifetime of most Americans in which a minority of the voting-age population cast ballots. Turnout dropped in every state between 1992 and 1996.That only 49% of eligible voters went to the polls in 1996 was especially disappointing for advocates of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA). The most dramatic liberalization of voter registration procedures in American history coincided with not only the lowest level of turnout since 1924, but with the largest single four-year decline since 1920. The theory that registration barriers are the chief cause of the gap between turnout rates of the U.S. and other developed democracies suffered a devastating blow, as turnout in North Dakota\u2014where voters aren't even required to register\u2014was a mere 56% of the voting-age population in 1996.Moreover, the turnout decline was heavily concentrated among \u201celectorally disadvantaged\u201d groups, particularly the young and residentially mobile, the very groups that reform activists expected would be the primary beneficiaries of easier registration.

Predation mortality of tadpoles increased with the duration of the experiment and was highest in the presence of the phytoplankton resource alone. This was explained by a decrease in prey activity in the benthic- and combined-resource treatments when the predator was present, whereas in the phytoplankton treatment, the activity of the tadpoles were similar in the presence or absence of the predator. In the presence of the predator, prey mainly used the bottom of the aquarium in the benthic- and combined-resource treatments. In contrast, in the phytoplankton treatment they used the water column more than in the other treatments. In the presence of the predator, the prey had a lower consumption rate in the phytoplankton treatment than in the other treatments. Predator activity did not change among treatments.

Although the compelling contrasts he experienced in his young adulthood, especially the competing commitments of science and religion, initially filled him with indecision and discouragement, he later synthesized the parts of his education into a platform for comprehending intellectual differences in relation to each other. James's approach to intellectual differences can be summarized with \u201cthree Rs\u201d: the psychological roots of intellectual differences, their relations to each other, and effective ways to respond to them. James's ideas offer an education in strategies for coping with disagreement based on understanding how differences emerge to encourage searching for bridges across diversity.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"History\", \"Food Science\"]", "language": "en", "length": [109, 0, 0], "string": "title={Food and Medicine in Medieval Islamic Hospitals : Preparation and Care in accordance with Dietetic Principles}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Political Science and International Relations\", \"Geography, Planning and Development\"]", "language": "en", "length": [85, 0, 1027], "string": "title={The League of Nations and Minorities: The Non-receivability of \u2018Non-treaty\u2019 Petitions}, container_title={}, abstract={Minority protection under the League of Nations (LoN) generated an unprecedented level of activity and debate on the topic, which in turn contributed to the general advancement of human rights.

testicular y tumor del saco vitelino.CASO CL\u00cdNICO: paciente masculino de 43 a\u00f1os de edad, con padecimiento de ocho meses de evoluci\u00f3n caracterizado por aumento de volumen testicular izquierdo, doloroso, de intensidad moderada, irradiado al miembro inferior ipsilateral, con cuadros de remisi\u00f3n y exacerbaci\u00f3n, acompa\u00f1ados de dificultad para la ventilaci\u00f3n.

El informe histopatol\u00f3gico fue de tumor mixto de c\u00e9lulas germinales compuesto por tumor de saco vitelino sarcomatoide (50%) y rabdomiosarcoma (30%).CONCLUSIONES: los rabdomiosarcomas intratesticulares son agresivos e infrecuentes. Es com\u00fan que al momento del diagn\u00f3stico los rabdomiosarcomas se manifiesten con afectaci\u00f3n ganglionar o met\u00e1stasis.

The mutant and, to a lesser extent, the normal ras gene caused reduction of the AFP mRNA but not the albumin mRNA level in transfected HuH-7 cells. Cotransfection experiments with a rasVal-12 expression plasmid and a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene fused to AFP regulatory sequences showed that rasVal-12 suppressed the activity of enhancer and promoter regions containing A + T-rich sequences (AT motif). In contrast, rasVal-12 did not affect the promoter activity of the albumin and human hepatitis B virus pre-S1 genes even though these promoters contain homologous A + T-rich elements. ras transfection appeared to induce phosphorylation of nuclear proteins that interact with the AFP AT motif, since gel mobility analysis revealed the formation of slow-moving complexes which was reversed by phosphatase treatment. However, similar changes in complex formation were observed with the albumin and hepatitis B surface antigen pre-S1 promoters. Therefore, this effect alone cannot explain the specific down regulation of the AFP promoter and enhancer activity. ras-mediated suppression of the AFP gene may reflect the process of developmental gene regulation in which AFP gene transcription is controlled by a G-protein-linked signal transduction cascade triggered by external growth stimuli.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

container_title={}, abstract={Cold heavy oil production with sand (CHOPS) has been applied successfully in many oil fields in Canada. However, typically only 5\u201315% of the original oil in place (OOIP) is recovered during cold production. Therefore, effective follow-up techniques are of great importance. Cyclic solvent injection (CSI), as a post-CHOPS process, has greater potential than continuous solvent injection to enhance heavy oil recovery. Continuous solvent injection results in early breakthrough due to the existence of wormholes; while in CSI process, the existence of wormholes can increase the contact area of solvent and heavy oil and the wormholes also provide channels that allow diluted oil to flow back to the wellbore. In this study, the effects of wormhole and sandpack model properties on the performance of the CSI process are experimentally investigated using three different cylindrical sandpack models. The length and diameter of the base model are 30.48 cm and 3.81 cm, respectively. The other two models, one with a larger length (i.e., 60.96 cm) and the other with a larger diameter (i.e., 15.24 cm), are used for up-scaling study in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the wormhole, respectively. The porosity and permeability of these models are about 35% and 5.5 Darcy typically. A typical western Canadian oil sample with a viscosity of 4330 mPa\u00b7s at 15 \u00b0C is used. And pure propane is selected as the solvent. The experimental results suggest that the existence of wormhole can significantly increase the oil production rate. The larger the wormhole coverage is, the better the CSI performance obtained. In terms of the effect of wormhole's location, a reservoir or well with wormholes developed at bottom is more favorable for post-CHOPS CSI process due to the gravity effect. The production of the CSI process can be divided into two phases: early time chamber rising and late time chamber spreading phases. The oil recovery factor in the chamber rising phase is almost independent of the sandpack model diameter; and the oil relative production rates (the oil production rate divided by the OOIP) in two models with different diameters are close during the chamber spreading phase due to similar solvent dispersion rate. It is also found that if the wormhole length is the same, the sandpack model length hardly affects the oil production rate in the earlier stage. In terms of the effects of the wormhole orientation, the well with a horizontal wormhole is inclined to get a good CSI performance. Through analyzing the experimental data, a relationship of oil production rate to drainage height is also obtained and verified.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

converter (DAC) for high-speed power line communication (PLC) modems is presented in this paper. The performance of current steering DAC is limited by the current cell mismatches and glitch problems caused by switching timing errors. In this paper, the current cell design procedure is presented to minimize random mismatches. Then, a new data-weighted averaging (DWA) technique with fewer glitches and low hardware complexity is proposed to compensate for the gradient mismatch. Spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) improvement and low complexity are effectively achieved by employing both a row\u2013column structure and a (CSA) structure as the floor plan of the proposed DAC. The proposed DAC is implemented in a standard 0.18-[Formula: see text]m CMOS process with an active area of 2.445[Formula: see text]mm2, which achieves a differential non linearity (DNL) of 0.25[Formula: see text]LSB and an integral non-linearity (INL) of 0.19[Formula: see text]LSB. Additionally, the SFDR increases by 13.2[Formula: see text]dB (on average) when employing the proposed DWA technique.

This limited focus is not for want of subject matter: the Inter-Parliamentary Union reports that of 178 parliamentary democracies in 1996, 58 were bicameral. Nor is the subject of second chambers, while never popular, a neglected area of inquiry at present. In fact, more has been published on the topic in the past four years than at any time in recent memory.

Previously, we identified an \u03b1-galactosidase (Aga1) belonging to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 36 from R. gnavus E1 (M. Aguilera, H. Rakotoarivonina, A. Brutus, T. Giardina, G. Simon, and M. Fons, Res. Microbiol. 163:14\u201321, 2012). Here, we identified a novel GH36-encoding gene from the same strain and termed it aga2 . Although aga1 showed a very simple genetic organization, aga2 is part of an operon of unique structure, including genes putatively encoding a regulator, a GH13, two phosphotransferase system (PTS) sequences, and a GH32, probably involved in extracellular and intracellular sucrose assimilation. The 727-amino-acid (aa) deduced Aga2 protein shares approximately 45% identity with Aga1. Both Aga1 and Aga2 expressed in Escherichia coli showed strict specificity for \u03b1-linked galactose. Both enzymes were active on natural substrates such as melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose. Aga1 and Aga2 occurred as homotetramers in solution, as shown by analytical ultracentrifugation. Modeling of Aga1 and Aga2 identified key amino acids which may be involved in substrate specificity and stabilization of the \u03b1-linked galactoside substrates within the active site. Furthermore, Aga1 and Aga2 were both able to perform transglycosylation reactions with \u03b1-(1,6) regioselectivity, leading to the formation of product structures up to [Hex] 12 and [Hex] 8 , respectively. We suggest that Aga1 and Aga2 play essential roles in the metabolism of dietary oligosaccharides and could be used for the design of galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS) prebiotics, known to selectively modulate the beneficial gut microbiota.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Pharmacology (medical)\", \"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging\", \"Oncology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [85, 13, 0], "string": "title={Contemplating chemosensitivity of basal-like breast cancer based on BRCA1 dysfunction}, container_title={Breast Cancer}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Civil and Structural Engineering\"]", "language": "en", "length": [86, 0, 918], "string": "title={Microstructural analysis of asphalt mixtures using digital image processing techniques}, container_title={}, abstract={In this paper, the internal microstructure of asphalt mixture is analyzed through digital image processing (DIP) of two-dimensional asphalt mixture images.

Columbia. The data suggest it was not a reservoir-induced earthquake.The earthquake was within a seismic array monitoring the reservoir and consequently, the epicenter is well constrained in a northwest-southeast direction. The preferred epicenter is 52.65\u00b0N, 118.89\u00b0W, slightly east of the Rocky Mountain Trench, with a shallow focal depth of about 10 km. There were no foreshocks but a normal aftershock sequence. The focal mechanism, the first for the eastern Canadian Cordillera, indicates predominantly right-lateral strike-slip faulting along the strike of the mountains with a significant thrust component. The moment is 4 \u00b1 2 \u00d7 1023 dyne-cm with a low stress drop (&lt;10 bars). A well-developed Lg phase was recorded to the south of the earthquake.

Recent transitions from mixed-species forests to post-fire shrublands after severe wildfire is an increasingly prevalent phenomenon in pine-oak and conifer forest ecosystems in southwestern North America. However, we know little about how variation in fire severity influences other common forest types in the region. In this study, we evaluated fire-induced changes in woody plant community composition and forest structure in Chiricahua Mountains in southeastern Arizona in the United States that hosts a diverse set of vegetation types. Cluster analysis of the pre-fire vegetation data identified three dominant pre-fire vegetation types including juniper woodland, pi\u00f1on forest, and pine-oak forest. All vegetation types experienced significant tree mortality across a wide range of size classes and species, from forests to shrublands. The magnitude of change within sample plots varied with fire severity, which was mediated by topography. Significant shifts in dominance away from coniferous obligate seeder trees to resprouting hardwoods and other shrubs occurred across all vegetation types in response to the fire. Regeneration from seed can be episodic, but projected increases in aridity and fire frequency may promote continued dominance by hardwoods and fire- and drought-resistant shrub communities, which is a regional forest management concern as wildfire size and severity continue to increase throughout the southwestern USA.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Materials Chemistry\", \"Condensed Matter Physics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [70, 0, 0], "string": "title={Lattice-vibration local modes due to U-centers in mixed alkali halides}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Genetics\", \"Agronomy and Crop Science\", \"Animal Science and Zoology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [87, 0, 803], "string": "title={Seedling vigour and grain yield of cereals grown from seeds of varying protein contents}, container_title={}, abstract={SUMMARYThe effect of seed protein content on grain yield has been studied in varieties of spring barley, oats and wheat grown under differing cultural conditions.

In a growth-room experiment, seed with high protein content produced more vigorous seedlings than low-protein seed; these differences were accentuated by increasing seedling age at very low nutrient levels, but decreased with seedling age at normal nutrient levels.

Oligotrophic Bradyrhizobium sp. Strain HW13 Isolated from a Pristine Environment}, container_title={}, abstract={ABSTRACT The tfd genes of Ralstonia eutropha JMP134 are the only well-characterized set of genes responsible for 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) degradation among 2,4-D-degrading bacteria. A new family of 2,4-D degradation genes, cadRABKC , was cloned and characterized from Bradyrhizobium sp. strain HW13, a strain that was isolated from a buried Hawaiian soil that has never experienced anthropogenic chemicals. The cadR gene was inferred to encode an AraC/XylS type of transcriptional regulator from its deduced amino acid sequence. The cadABC genes were predicted to encode 2,4-D oxygenase subunits from their deduced amino acid sequences that showed 46, 44, and 37% identities with the TftA and TftB subunits of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) oxygenase of Burkholderia cepacia AC1100 and with a putative ferredoxin, ThcC, of Rhodococcus erythropolis NI86/21, respectively. They are thoroughly different from the 2,4-D dioxygenase gene, tfdA , of R. eutropha JMP134. The cadK gene was presumed to encode a 2,4-D transport protein from its deduced amino acid sequence that showed 60% identity with the 2,4-D transporter, TfdK, of strain JMP134. Sinorhizobium meliloti Rm1021 cells containing cadRABKC transformed several phenoxyacetic acids, including 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, to corresponding phenol derivatives. Frameshift mutations indicated that each of the cadRABC genes was essential for 2,4-D conversion in strain Rm1021 but that cadK was not. Five 2,4-D degraders, including Bradyrhizobium and Sphingomonas strains, were found to have cadA gene homologs, suggesting that these 2,4-D degraders share 2,4-D degradation genes similar to those of strain HW13 cadABC .}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Horticulture\", \"Plant Science\", \"Soil Science\", \"Agronomy and Crop Science\", \"Food Science\"]", "language": "en", "length": [153, 33, 1191], "string": "title={Response Of Guava Trees (Psidium Guajava) To Soil Applications Of Mineral And Organic Fertilisers And Biofertilisers Under Conditions Of Low Fertile Soil}, container_title={Journal of Horticultural Research}, abstract={Abstract The goal of this study was to assess the influence of different organic fertilisers - vermicompost, mulching, Azotobacter, phosphate solubilising microbes (PSM) and Trichoderma harzianum added each year to mineral fertilisers containing NPK and to farmyard manure (FYM) on leaf nutrient status, tree growth, fruit yield and quality of guava grown in low fertile soil.

However, the role of Cdr1as in the tumourigenesis of bladder cancer and its potential mechanisms remain unknown. Methods: qRT-PCR was used to detect Cdr1as and target miRNA expression in bladder cancer tissues and cell lines. Biological functional experiments were performed to detect the effects of Cdr1as on the biological behaviour of bladder cancer cells in vivo and in vitro. Bioinformatic analysis was utilised to predict potential miRNA target sites on Cdr1as. Ago2 RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation assay, RNA antisense purification assay, biotin pull down assay and RNA FISH were performed to detect the interaction between Cdr1as and target miRNAs. Western blot was used to determine the expression level of p21 in bladder cancer cells. Results: Cdr1as was significantly down-regulated in bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Overexpression of Cdr1as inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of bladder cancer cells in vitro and slowed down tumour growth in vivo. Cdr1as sponged multiple miRNAs in bladder cancer. Moreover, Cdr1as directly bound to miR-135a and inhibited its activity in bladder cancer. Conclusion: Cdr1as is down-regulated and sponges multiple miRNAs in bladder cancer. It exerts anti-oncogenic functions by sponging microRNA-135a.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Behavioral Neuroscience\", \"Developmental Biology\", \"Developmental Neuroscience\", \"Developmental and Educational Psychology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [105, 0, 0], "string": "title={Behavioral and neural correlates of postnatal olfactory conditioning: II.

Melanomas are most commonly localized in the skin but can arise anywhere in the body where melanocytes exist. Gastrointestinal melanoma (GM) is a rare form of this disease. The prognosis of GM is poor compared to that of skin melanoma (SM), however GM has not been well characterized. GM is difficult to diagnose at an early stage because of the anatomical location. Furthermore, it is usually challenging for pathologists to diagnose GM, especially given the small amount of biopsy samples usually collected. In the present study, we examined the differences between GM and SM. Design: The clinicopathological characteristics, morphological feature, mitosis rate, expression of melanoma stem cell markers (nestin, SOX2, and ABCB5), and presence of the BRAFV600E mutation were evaluated for 10 cases of GM and 31 of SM. Results: Patients with GM tended to be older than those with SM. Moreover, GMs were more likely to be amelanotic (50% vs. 7%, P=0.001) and to display round cells (70% vs. 23%, P=0.02) than were SMs, and the mitosis rate was higher in GMs than in SMs (P&lt;0.05). The incidence of lymph-node metastasis (60% vs. 32%, P&lt;0.05) and distant metastasis (10% vs. 6.5%, P=0.02) was higher in GMs than in SMs at the point of resection. Expression of stem cell markers did not differ between groups; however, in SM, advanced-stage disease was associated with higher expression of nestin than was early-stage disease (P&lt;0.05). Immunohistochemically, the expression of BRAFV600E was lower in GMs than in SMs (1.0 vs 3.3, P=0.01). Conclusion: Our investigation revealed that, compared to SM patients, GMs were generally older, more likely to display round cells, and be amelanotic. Moreover, they had a lower frequency of BRAFV600E mutations than did SM patients. We believe that identification of these features may aid in the diagnosis of GM and SM and contribute to new targeted therapies for GM.

Values up to \u22120.07 and \u22120.2 mC m\u22122are found for Teflon AF and for Cytop, respectively, at elevated pH. A similar charge trapping process is also observed upon aging in various non-aqueous polar liquids and in humid air. A careful analysis highlights the complementary nature of electrowetting and streaming potential measurements in quantifying interfacial energy and charge density. We discuss the possible mechanism of charge trapping and highlight the relevance of molecular scale processes for the long term stability and performance of fluoropolymer materials for applications in electrowetting and elsewhere.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Ten 1 meter square plots were put at sandy beach and number of Scopimera sp be counted by the number of their hole nest home. Their feeding behaviour observed directly by eye-watching and video making. The threatening of bird predator was noted too. The investigation find out that the mean of crabs population is 17 individu/m2 . They come out from home hole for feeding around by sieving wet sand that be taken by front legs, obsorb organic nutrious material by mouth and kick residual sand to behind legs, move it as a small sand ball to right of left back side. Production of small ball sand were about 15 - 30 balls /per minute. For making the nest hole, bigger sand ball were produced about 7 \u2013 9 ball/minute; ball colour is same with under layer beach sand; quite grey.

In addition, a number of recent high-performance systems feature tip\u2013tilt controllers that are more efficient than the integral action controller. In this context, linear\u2013quadratic\u2013Gaussian (LQG) tip\u2013tilt regulators based on stochastic models identified from AO telemetry have demonstrated their capacity to effectively compensate for the cumulated effects of atmospheric disturbance, windshake and vibrations. These tip\u2013tilt LQG regulators can also be periodically retuned during AO operations, thus allowing to track changes in the disturbances\u2019 temporal dynamics. This paper investigates the potential benefit of extending the number of low-order modes to be controlled using models identified from AO telemetry. The global stochastic dynamical model of a chosen number of turbulent low-order modes is identified through data-driven modelling from wavefront sensor measurements. The remaining higher modes are modelled using priors with autoregressive models of order 2. The loop is then globally controlled using the optimal LQG regulator build from all these models. Our control strategy allows for combining a dedicated tip\u2013tilt loop with a deformable mirror that corrects for the remaining low-order modes and for the higher orders altogether, without resorting to mode decoupling. Performance results are obtained through evaluation of the Strehl ratio computed on H-band images from the scientific camera, or in replay mode using on-sky AO telemetry recorded in 2019 July on the

Current deep learning algorithms based on convolutional neural networks have the advantages of high accuracy, low cost, and high speeds in processing image-based data, but their ability to process the relationship between visual elements and objects is inferior to Transformer. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved YOLOX target detection algorithm combining Swin Transformer architecture, the CBAM attention mechanism, and a Slim Neck structure applied to flame smoke detection in laboratory fires. The experimental results verify that the improved YOLOX algorithm has higher detection accuracy and more accurate position recognition for flame smoke in complex situations, with APs of 92.78% and 92.46% for flame and smoke, respectively, and an mAP value of 92.26%, compared with the original YOLOX algorithm, SSD, Faster R-CNN, YOLOv4, and YOLOv5.

The cross-sectional geometry shape of the leaf blade presented a strong influence on the optimized flexural stiffness.

This study evaluated the reliabilities of two well-behaved NWP centers in the Observing System Research and Predictability Experiment (THORPEX) Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), in EPF and ESP over a mountain river basin in China. This evaluation was carried out based on both deterministic and probabilistic metrics at a daily temporal scale. The effectiveness of two postprocessing methods, the Generator-based Postprocessing (GPP) method, and the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) method were also investigated for EPF and ESP. Results showed that: (1) The ECMWF shows better performances than NCEP in both EPF and ESP in terms of evaluation indexes and representation of the hydrograph. (2) The GPP method performs better than BMA in improving both EPF and ESP performances, and the improvements are more significant for the NCEP with worse raw performances. (3) Both ECMWF and NCEP have good potential for both EPF and ESP. By using the GPP method, there are desirable EPF performances for both ECMWF and NCEP at all 7 lead days, as well as highly skillful ECMWF ESP for 1~5 lead days and average moderate skillful NCEP ESP for all 7 lead days. The results of this study can provide a reference for the applications of TIGGE over mountain river basins.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Psychiatry and Mental Health\", \"Clinical Psychology\", \"Health (social science)\"]", "language": "en", "length": [99, 38, 0], "string": "title={Lesbian, Gay, and Transgender Individuals with Mental Illness: Narratives of the Acceptance Process}, container_title={Journal of Gay & Lesbian Mental Health}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)\"]", "language": "en", "length": [113, 0, 766], "string": "title={A commentary on the shape of loess particles assuming a spatial exponential distribution for the cracks in quartz}, container_title={}, abstract={AbstractAn important property of loess is a tendency to collapse on loading and wetting (hydroconsolidation) which can have serious consequences worldwide for civil engineering projects.

One of the most significant results of the study is the indicated one-third higher recovery efficiency of gas-drivel/gravity-drainage as compared with water drive for this reservoir. Introduction The Hawkins (Woodbine) field was unitized Jan. 1, 1975, following a reservoir study that showed that a gas injection project would increase oil recovery by an estimated 189 million bbl. This additional oil recovery would result from preventing future gas-cap shrinkage and from replacing a moderately efficient water-displacement mechanism with highly efficient gas-drive/gravity-drainage.Field performance indicated that gas displacement accompanied by gravity drainage will recover about one-third more of the remaining oil column than possible using water displacement. This observed difference in recovery efficiency was verified by simple mathematical models, core data, and finite-difference reservoir simulators. Field Description The Hawkins (Woodbine) field produced more than 530 million bbl of oil from discovery in 1940 through 1974. The field, located in the Woodbine basin of Texas, shares a common aquifer with East Texas, Van, Neches, and other Woodbine fields. It is located about 100 miles east of Dallas, as Fig. 1 shows. The Hawkins field produces 112,000 BOPD, and had 510 active producers at the end of 1974. Production is from the Woodbine formation of Upper Cretaceous Production is from the Woodbine formation of Upper Cretaceous age. The Woodbine formation is divided into upper, Lewisville sands and lower, Dexter sands. The Dexter sands, thicker and more permeable than the Lewisville sands, contain about 80 percent of permeable than the Lewisville sands, contain about 80 percent of the field's oil reserve.The field is divided into two segments by a major north-south fault. The western segment contains about 80 percent of the field's oil reserve. A unique property of the Hawkins field is an asphalt zone that underlies the oil column in the western segment. Early reservoir studies indicated that the aquifer pressure near the Hawkins field had been drawn down at time of discovery by withdrawals from other fields in the Woodbine basin, particularly the East Texas field. Pressure-interference effects in the Woodbine basin have been studied extensively; this basin provides a classic example of pressure interference over a wide area. Reservoir Properties The first step in the engineering study was determination of reservoir properties.Fig. 2, a composite log showing the Lewisville and Dexter sand members, is fundamental to understanding reservoir rock properties. The Lewisville sands are lenticular, and the total properties. The Lewisville sands are lenticular, and the total Lewisville section averages 70-percent shale. The Dexter sands are massive and continuous, and the total section is about 70-percent sand. Table 1 shows the average sand properties obtained from analyzing 35,900 ft of conventional cores from 193 wells in the field.

AT is characterized by pain, swelling, and impaired performance. ATs can be divided into two types, according to anatomical location\u2014midportion AT (MAT) and insertional AT (IAT). MAT more often occurs in older, less active, and overweight populations, while IAT usually occurs in the more physically active population. Both types of AT can be treated by different treatments, such as surgery, conservative pharmacological treatments, and conservative nonpharmacological treatments. This umbrella review aims to assemble the evidence from all available systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses to determine which conservative nonpharmacological treatments are most commonly used and have the greatest effects. Three major electronic scientific databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) were screened. The reference lists of several recent articles on AT were also searched. We found 50 articles that met the inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of the included articles was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 tool. Eccentric (ECC) exercise, isotonic (ISOT) exercise, and acupuncture treatment showed the greatest effects for treating MAT as a standalone therapy. Meanwhile, extracorporeal shockwave therapy and ECC exercise provided the best outcomes for treating IAT as individual treatments. However, an even greater pain decrease, greater function improvement, and greater patient satisfaction for treating either MAT or IAT were achieved with combined protocols of ECC exercise with extracorporeal shockwave therapy (in both cases), ECC exercise with cold air and high-energy laser therapy (in the case of IAT), or ECC exercise with ASTYM therapy (in the case of IAT).}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Management of Technology and Innovation\"]", "language": "en", "length": [91, 0, 1300], "string": "title={Exchange of knowledge in protected environments.

In these contexts, the exchange of knowledge among entrepreneurs can be a key variable for the development and success of their businesses. This paper aims to analyse the characteristics of entrepreneurs' resources and the institutional logic that prevails in the incubator as determinants of the exchange of knowledge, and the authors examine the results in terms of entrepreneurial commitment and the generation of innovations.Design/methodology/approachThe empirical study carried out on a sample of 101 entrepreneurs in UBIs in Spain and The Netherlands.FindingsThe results reveals how complementarity, supplementarity and transferability of resources, as well as incubator predisposition towards business are fundamental for the exchange of knowledge, the development of entrepreneurial spirit and the generation of innovation.Originality/valueThis study makes a contribution towards an understanding of how relationships

container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Using striped bass (Morone saxatilis) and six multiplexed microsatellite markers, we evaluated procedures for estimating allele frequencies by pooling DNA from multiple individuals, a method suggested as cost-effective relative to individual genotyping. Using moment-based estimators, we estimated allele frequencies in experimental DNA pools and found that the three primary laboratory steps, DNA quantitation and pooling, PCR amplification, and electrophoresis, accounted for 23, 48, and 29%, respectively, of the technical variance of estimates in pools containing DNA from 2\u201324 individuals. Exact allele-frequency estimates could be made for pools of sizes 2\u20138, depending on the locus, by using an integer-valued estimator. Larger pools of size 12 and 24 tended to yield biased estimates; however, replicates of these estimates detected allele frequency differences among pools with different allelic compositions. We also derive an unbiased estimator of Hardy\u2013Weinberg disequilibrium coefficients that uses multiple DNA pools and analyze the cost-efficiency of DNA pooling. DNA pooling yields the most potential cost savings when a large number of loci are employed using a large number of individuals, a situation becoming increasingly common as microsatellite loci are developed in increasing numbers of taxa.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

As an engineering application, adaptive synchronization of the new chaotic jerk system with itself is designed via backstepping control method. Furthermore, an electronic circuit realization of the new chaotic jerk system is presented in detail to confirm the feasibility of the theoretical chaotic jerk model.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Organic Chemistry\", \"Molecular Biology\", \"Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology\", \"Biochemistry\", \"Analytical Chemistry\", \"Biotechnology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [106, 43, 1133], "string": "title={In vitro and in vivo evaluation of antioxidant activity of Petasites japonicus Maxim. flower buds extracts}, container_title={Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry}, abstract={ABSTRACT The antioxidant activity of Petasites japonicus flower buds cultivated in Tokushima, Japan, was examined in vitro and in vivo. The flower bud extracts were assayed using either oxygen radical absorbance capacity or 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. Antioxidants in the 80% ethanol extract were investigated using online high-performance liquid chromatography-DPPH and were identified as caffeic acid, 3-O-caffeoylquinic acid, fukinolic acid, 3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, and 4,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid using liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry. Fukinolic acid was the most active compound based on its activity and abundance. Administering the extracts orally to ICR mice prior to iron injection significantly suppressed plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) production. Moreover, TBARS and triglyceride concentrations in the plasma of C57BL/6 mice fed with a high fat diet were also significantly decreased by the extract.

Changing conditions resulted in dynamic depositional environments that recorded the migration and stabilization of modern shorelines. These processes are viewed in the Zevulun Plain (Haifa Bay, Israel) record located in the northern edge of the Nile littoral cell. Sedimentological and palaeontological analyses combined with dating enabled the reconstruction of the Holocene chrono-stratigraphical frame. The results reveal an unconformity representing a long period of exposure and erosion during the last glacial. The interplay between relative sea-level rise and sediment supply was first set out by the deposition of alluvial sediments, evidence of the hydrological system reactivation and base level landward migration. Sea flooding of the Zevulun Plain started about 7.8 cal ka BP and the coastline was pushed eastward. Nile-driven sands transported by longshore currents formed dunes that blocked the rivers estuaries and led to wetlands formation. Peat accumulation is evident first in the north of the plain at 7.6\u20136.2 cal ka BP and later in the south at 6.5\u20135.5 cal ka BP. Both wetlands showed a change from fresh to brackish water environments at the end of their existence. Following the maximum sea-level rise and inland sea invasion at about 4 ka BP, alluvial sediments covered the plain and the coastline moved westward to its current position. This record serves as a model for the development of Mediterranean clastic coasts controlled by sea rise and infill processes.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

abstract={Abstract Antihypertensive treatment is highly effective in both primary and secondary prevention of stroke. However, current guideline recommendations on the blood pressure goals in acute stroke are clinically empirical and generally conservative. Antihypertensive treatment is only recommended for severe hypertension. Several recent observational studies showed that the relationship between blood pressure and unfavorable clinical outcomes was probably positive in acute hemorrhagic stroke but J- or U-shaped in acute ischemic stroke with undetermined nadir blood pressure. The results of randomized controlled trials are promising for blood pressure management in hemorrhagic stroke but less so in ischemic stroke. A systolic blood pressure goal of 140 mm Hg is probably appropriate for acute hemorrhagic stroke. The blood pressure goal in acute ischemic stroke, however, is uncertain, and probably depends on the time window of treatment and the use of revascularization therapy. Further research is required to investigate the potential benefit of antihypertensive treatment in acute stroke, especially with regard to the possible reduction of blood pressure variability and more intensive blood pressure lowering in the acute and subacute phases of a stroke, respectively.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Surgery\"]", "language": "en", "length": [29, 0, 0], "string": "title={Complications of Fat Grafting}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cancer Research\", \"Oncology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [83, 21, 2198], "string": "title={Bibliometric study on the knowledge graph of immunotherapy for head and neck cancer}, container_title={Frontiers in Oncology}, abstract={BackgroundHead and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a common malignant tumor with a significant mortality rate, especially in patients at locally advanced stage, or with recurrence and metastasis. Immunotherapy has shown remarkable breakthrough in the treatment of locally advanced cancer, recurrence and metastasis in recent years. During this time, a large number of HNSCC immunotherapy studies have been published. However, few studies employed bibliometric analysis. This work analyzes HNSCC immunotherapy trends and hotspots using bibliometric analysis to get better understanding of the current state and future direction of HNSCC immunotherapy.MethodsRelevant articles and publications about immunotherapy of HNSCC were extracted from Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). Bibliometrics was used to study these publications in terms of countries/regions, institutions, authors (cited authors), journals (cited journals), references, and keywords, so as to identify research hotspots and to predict future research trends in this field.ResultsA total of 1377 English articles published between 2000 and 2022 were collected. It is found that the number of articles increases rapidly from 2016. The United States has the largest number of publications (n=538), followed by China (n=407) and Germany (n=175). The institute with the highest published papers is the University of Pittsburgh (n=67). In terms of author, Robert L Ferris ranks first among the top ten cited authors. Oral Oncology (impact factor (IF) (2021) = 5.972) is the most prolific academic journal in immunotherapy of HNSCC. According to the reference cluster analysis, the research hot topic has shifted from basic research on immunotherapy of head and neck cancer to the study of prognosis. Keywords analysis also reveals that the study of patients\u2019 prognoses is at the core of immunotherapy for HNSCC.ConclusionCurrently, head and neck cancer research focus primarily on prognostic significance, cancer treatment, and poor prognosis. However, the researches on immunotherapy for head and neck malignancies is the growing trend in near future.

Autophagy-lysosomal Signaling In Mice With Hypercholesterolemic Diet}, container_title={}, abstract={Accumulating evidence indicates coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) contributes to myocardial ischemia with or without epicardial coronary atherosclerosis. However, it remains unknown which molecular pathway is associated with compromised coronary microvascular function preceding the development of myocardial ischemic injury. Recent studies suggest that autophagy-lysosomal signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of endothelial homeostasis under various metabolic stresses such as hypercholesterolemia. In this study, the early effects of hypercholesterolemia on the function and integrity of coronary microcirculation were studied in mice and the expressions of various molecular markers of autophagy-lysosome pathway were also determined in the coronary circulation. Mice were fed a hypercholesterolemic paigen diet (PD) for 8 weeks and coronary microvascular function was determined by measuring coronary flow reserve (CFR) under baseline and hyperemic conditions. The effects of PD on cardiac function or remodeling were also assessed by echocardiograph or immunohistochemistry studies. In PD-fed hypercholesterolemic mice, hyperemia-induced increase in CFR was significantly abrogated compared to that in normal chow diet-fed (ND) control mice (PD: 1.583\u00b10.4193 vs. ND: 3.087\u00b10.586) (n=7-8). The diet-induced hypercholesterolemia did not lead to cardiac dysfunction (EF%, PD: 59.870\u00b17.549 vs ND: 64.040\u00b19.088) or hypertrophic remodeling (LV mass (mg), PD: 92.240\u00b114.410 vs ND: 96.030\u00b125.07). PD increased mild cardiac inflammation and fibrosis but did not resulted in rarefaction in the myocardium. In small coronary arterial wall, PD induced endothelial inflammasome activation and inflammation, which was accompanied by upregulation of autophagy and lysosome signaling pathway. In conclusion, hypercholesterolemic diet induces CMD without alterations in cardiac function or remodeling. These alterations in coronary microvascular function represent the early effects of diet-induced hypercholesterolemia, which may be ameliorated with activation of autophagy and lysosome signaling pathways.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Considering the high number and the layered structure of the evolved node B (eNodeB, eNB) in the initial rollout phase, the assigning of PCI for cells would be quite complex. The PCI self-distributing problem is mapped to the well-known minimum spanning tree (MST) problem in order to optimize the PCI reuse distance and decrease the multiplexing interference. The correlation property of PCI is analyzed and taken into consideration in the assigning phase. Moreover, a suboptimal algorithm (SADPCI) is presented as it performs approximately to ADPCI but the computational complexity is lower. To demonstrate the proposal validity, performances of ADPCI and SADPCI are evaluated. Simulation results illustrate that these schemes can achieve significantly higher performance even under the condition of severe PCI deficiency.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Long-term outcomes are limited by high mortality in a comorbid population. Purpose We aimed to evaluate early prosthesis hemodynamic performance and late clinical outcomes following TMVIV. Methods All patients who underwent TMVIV for degenerated surgical mitral bioprostheses from 2011 to 2020 in our center were included. Prospectively collected demographic, clinical, procedural, and imaging variables were analyzed. Clinical and echocardiographic outcomes were defined according to Mitral Valve Academic Research Consortium (MVARC) definitions and assessed at 30-day and at the latest follow-up available. Results A total of 67 patients were included; mean age 76.9\u00b19.6 years, mean STS score 11.0\u00b16.2%, 53.7% male (n=36). Mechanisms of bioprosthetic failure were mitral stenosis (n=32, 47.8%), mitral regurgitation (n=24, 35.8%), and mixed (n=11, 16.4%). Mean time from mitral valve surgery to TMVIV was 10.2\u00b14.3 years. Access was mostly transapical (n=45; 67.2%), followed by transseptal (n=22; 32.8%). Following the first transseptal procedure in 2016; transseptal access accounted for the majority of procedures (22 of 37 cases, 59.4%). Technical success was achieved in 65 patients (97.0%). Mean hospitalization was 9.2\u00b110.0 days; shorter with the transseptal as opposed to the transapical approach (6.3\u00b18.1 days versus 11.0\u00b110.5 days, p=0.001). At 30-day echographic follow-up, mean mitral valve gradient was 7.3\u00b12.7 and 1 patient (1.9%) had mitral regurgitation &gt;mild. At 30-day follow-up, 3 patients had died (4.5%); due to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (1), heart failure (1), and stroke (1). New pacemakers were required in 2 patients (3.0%) and pacemaker lead dislodgement occurred in 1 patient (1.5%), 4 patients (6.2%) were hospitalized for heart failure. At a median follow-up of 3.8 years [1.7\u20135.1], 29 patients had died (43.3%), valve thrombosis was found in 6 (8.9%) and endocarditis in 4 patients (6.2%). Mitral valve reintervention was performed in 4 patients (6.2%); redo TMVIV due to valve migration in 1 (1.9%), surgical valve replacement in 1 (1.9%), and delayed redilation with a non-compliant balloon due to underexpansion in 2 patients (3.8%). Conclusion TMVIV is associated with acceptable 30-day mitral valve hemodynamics. Long-term mortality remains high in this high-surgical risk comorbid group.

In most of these cases, variable combinations of hot environment, physical exercise, dehydration, and infection can be identified. Heat stroke is a complex clinical picture with poorly understood pathophysiology and unexplored resuscitation potentials. Protection of vital organs against hyperthermia is also important for cancer therapy.This study (1978\u20131980) was aimed exclusively at the effects of controlled hyperthermia. In pilot experiments on lightly anesthetized dogs and rhesus monkeys, brain temperature was raised to 42\u00b0C for 1/2\u20131 hour by immersion heating. This was followed by cooling to normothermia. Partial recovery with a lucid period of 1 hour or longer was followed by diffuse gastrointestinal bleeding and irreversible shock in spite of standard life support measures.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Neurology (clinical)\", \"Surgery\"]", "language": "en", "length": [66, 0, 0], "string": "title={Magnetic resonance imaging of infiltrating angiolipoma of the neck}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Biochemistry (medical)\", \"Clinical Biochemistry\"]", "language": "en", "length": [20, 0, 0], "string": "title={the clinical chemist}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Sociology and Political Science\"]", "language": "en", "length": [55, 0, 0], "string": "title={The Struggle for Imperial Unity (1868-1895).J.

We built a temporal transcriptional network of B-cell receptor (BCR) crosslinking in CLL and healthy B-cells, a critical step to understand the dynamics of BCR gene expression and to understand gene regulation at a system level. CLL cells have defects in apoptosis and the BCR pathway appears crucial in this process, leading to differential signaling and cell response according to the Ig gene mutational status and zap70 expression. We built this network by analysis of the gene expression profile after BCR crosslinking in six mutated (M) and six unmutated (UM) CLL cells and six healthy B-cells. After a pilot study examining multiple time points, total RNA was purified at four time points (60 to 390 min) from stimulated (S) and unstimulated (US) cells, for a total of 170 HU133plus2.0 DNA-chips analyzed. The logarithmic ratio data log(S/US) for each time point and each patient and the linear combination for four time points were analyzed to score expression over time. This temporal clustering discriminates healthy B-cells from CLL-cells, but now also distinguishes two groups of patients, one mainly UM with higher zap70 protein levels. BCR engagement induces different gene expression for this group of aggressive CLL. We built a temporal model of gene expression for these three groups using two iterative steps. The first step is a modified K-means clustering approach using log(S/US) of temporal gene expression. This results in groups of genes with common temporal structure whose expression exhibits significant differences after BCR stimulation. The number of considered genes were then reduced, keeping a small number with the largest increase in expression within each group. Most of these genes are important in BCR transcription including JUN, DUSP1 and NFkB and most first wave genes are transcription factors. The second step is to construct predictive models of gene expression, considering only causal linear predictive models. Specifically the expression of an output gene at each time is predicted using a weighted linear combination of the expression of another gene at past time points. The method groups pairs of genes by common predictive model. While paired genes may reside in different initial clusters, upon convergence they are clustered by which predictive models they use. The procedure first assigns random pairings of genes and then we iterate between two steps, computing the best predictive model using a regularized least squares algorithm emphasizing sparse models and optimal gene pairings using a modified Hungarian bipartite graph matching approach. In practice the method converges in a small number of iterations. To refine and test this model we use RNAi to silence genes in the first wave of transcription after BCR stimulation and study the impact on the model. From the global gene regulatory network, we aim to predict the minimal number of gene to silence to influence the global structure of the BCR regulatory network. Influencing the transcriptional structure of aggressive CLL toward that of indolent CLL and healthy B-cells is a first step to reprogram the transcriptional response of leukemic cells.}",

Previous studies have reported increased lung cancer risk with past history of lung disease such as tuberculosis and asthma, and with polymorphisms of genes in the inflammatory pathway. We examined the effect of self-reported chronic lung disease and allergic conditions and 6 polymorphisms in key inflammatory genes on lung cancer risk in a group of non-smoking Chinese women. Methods 434 never-smoker primary lung cancer cases and 1375 controls were recruited from 4 major hospitals in Singapore in 2 case-control studies (conducted 1996-8 and 2005-8) using similar methods and questionnaires. Data on relevant exposures were obtained by in-hospital face-to-face interviews. 6 polymorphisms in the interleukin 1-\u03b2 (IL1-\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL6), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3), and interleukin-1\u03b2 receptor antagonist (IL1-\u03b2Ra) genes were genotyped. Results A previous history of chronic lung disease (TB/chronic bronchitis or emphysema) increased the risk of lung cancer (Adjusted OR 1.33, 95%CI 1.06-1.66). This increased risk was not modified by the inflammatory genotypes studied. We noticed a main effect on lung cancer of polymorphism in the 1L6 gene, a pro-inflammatory cytokine present in high levels in lung tumour tissue, but not in the other polymorphisms studied. The C/G or G/G genotype at the IL6-634C/G Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) site (which has been shown to increase the production and secretion of IL6) was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (OR 1.37, 95%CI 1.02-1.82) compared to the C/C genotype. While a history of asthma/atopy alone did not enhance risk (OR 0.98, 95%CI 0.75-1.27), interactions were observed between hypersensitivity and polymorphisms in 2 inflammatory pathway genes. A history of asthma/atopy and the presence of the T/T genotype at IL1-\u03b2-31T/C SNP site conferred a risk of 2.31 (95%CI 1.26-4.24, Likelihood Ratio [LR] test for interaction p = 0.016), compared to no asthma/atopy and a C/C genotype. A history of asthma/atopy and the presence of either *1/*2 or *2/*2 genotypes of the IL1-bRa gene was associated with a risk of 2.81 (95%CI 1.18-6.71, LR test p = 0.034) compared to no asthma/atopy and the *1/*1 genotype. In both cases, the increased risk associated with asthma/atopy was restricted only to those individuals with the at-risk genotypes. Conclusion These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that chronic inflammation plays a role in lung cancer development in non-smoking Asian women.

(CNSC) are becoming increasingly recognized as healthcare-associated (HA) pathogens, but data on clinical and molecular epidemiology, species diversity and mechanisms of carbapenem resistance are lacking. Methods We reviewed patients at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center with CNSC positive cultures from 2000 to 2018. The diversity of CNSC species among a subset of isolates from all UPMC sites was confirmed by 16S rRNA typing, and the presence of carbapenemase enzymes in the same isolates was determined by PCR amplificon. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution. Significance of epidemiological trends over time was determined by linear regression, and correlation with antibiotic consumption was determined by cross-correlation using STATA v15. Results Between 2000 and 2018, 3% (78/2817) of all Citrobacter sp. were CNS. CNSC rates increased from 4% in 2000 to 10% in 2018 (R2 = 0.206, P = 0.05), as did carbapenem consumption (6.5\u201334.5 DDDs/1000, R2 = 0.831, P Conclusion CNSC species are diverse, have emerged as an HA pathogen at our center, and cause high rates of mortality.

Thell. or T. turgidum L.) and other members of the tribe Triticeae to assess the potential of alien species as donors of cold-hardiness genes for the improvement of wheat. Thinopyrum ponticum (Agropyron elongatum) hybrids with nonhardy T. aestivum had cold-hardiness levels similar to that of the more hardy Thinopyrum parent. Hybrids of Triticum cylindricum and both hardy and nonhardy T. aestivum were intermediate in cold hardiness with a tendency toward greater hardiness than the parental mean. Cold hardiness of hybrids between T. aestivum and Thinopyrum intermedium (Agropyron intermedium) was also close to the parental midpoint. Cold hardiness of T. aestivum \u2013 Secale cereale hybrids was greater than the less hardy parent. In contrast, cold-hardiness genes were not expressed beyond the level of the wheat parent in amphiploids combining wheat and the very hardy diploid species Agropyron cristatum and Secale cereale. The cold-hardiness level was also poor in an amphiploid produced from two relatively hardy tetraploid species (T. turgidum and T. cylindricum). These observations indicate that changes in ploidy level, relative to the parents, may influence the cold-hardiness potential of an interspecific combination by affecting gene dosage and possibly cell size. Poor expression of cold-hardiness genes from very hardy diploid genomes also indicated some degree of suppression, or homoeoallelic dominance of wheat cold-hardiness genes in amphiploids. Therefore, the performance of an interspecific hybrid or amphiploid of wheat may not give an accurate indication of the potential of alien species as gene donors for the improvement of wheat cold

The rats were divided into five groups and each group was chronically treated with different sets of three immunosuppressive drugs (TRG, CRG, MRG, CMG, TMG) for 6 months. The changes were most profound in calcineurin inhibitor-based protocols. TMG protocol treatment was characterized by the most numerous alterations such as morphological changes, changes in the thickness of the tunic media, wider distances between elastic lamellae, an increase in the number of vSMCs and changes in collagen deposition.

mechanical switcher using Solid State Devices (SSR) as the medium of relaying high power AC load has already been recommended five decades ago using Dual Thyristor or Triac. The rapid growth in SSR field has now resulted in using dual IGBTs, dual JFETs, dual MOSFETs or dual HEMTs semiconductor devices to control high powered AC loads. One of the drawbacks of all the systems above is that they all using two semiconductor devices to operate for both half cycle of the single phase AC waveform, with either anti-parallel or anti series-arrangement incorporated. We have modeled a novel SSR, using only one MOSFET semiconductor device with a new SSR module packaging. This novel Uni-MOSFET SSR is capable of operating on both half cycles of an AC waveform and eliminating problems associated with dual semiconductor SSR system. Moreover, in this paper we have explained the simulations proving that the Uni-MOSFET SSR is able to control resistive load and able to compensate capacitive and inductive as a SVC, which is as good as its predecessor the Dual-Thyristor SSR. The draw back would be the complexity of the control signals of the Uni-MOSFET SSR for TCR but we have managed to simplify using equations. Our novel SSR is cost efficient, low noise and works well as a load switcher, circuit breaker or compensation switch for single phase electrical network system.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0,

food science and health, both research and operational. On the other hand, anti-biofilm properties on food pathogens in the food and pharmaceutical industries have created an attractive challenge. This study aimed to describe the inhibitory activity of cell-free supernatants (CFS), planktonic cells, and biofilm form of lactobacilus strains (L. rhamnosus and L. plantarum) against food pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Listeria monocytogenes. Anti-bacterial activities of the CFS of lactobacillus strains were assessed by the microplate method and via violet staining. Evaluation of the antagonistic activity of planktonic cells and biofilm of LAB were performed by the spread plate method. The results showed the incubation time of 48 h was the best time to produce biofilm. Although the planktonic states reduce the pathogens bacterial about 1 \u20131.5 log, but in biofilm forms, decreased L. monocytogenes about 4.5 log compared to the control, and in the case of P. aeruginosa, a growth reduction of about 2.13 log was observed. Furthermore, biofilm formation of L. monocytogenes in the presence of L. rhamnosus cell-free supernatant was more weakly than L. plantarum CFS, but their CFS effect on reducing the bacterial population of P. aeruginosa was the same. According to the study, biofilm produced by probiotic strains can be considered a new approach for biological control. Also, cell-free supernatant can be used as postbiotic in the food and pharmaceutical industries.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

receptor (MR) antagonists (MRAs) for various kidney diseases are established. However, the underlying mechanisms of kidney injury induced by MR activation remain to be elucidated. We recently reported aldosterone-induced enhancement of proteoglycan expression in mitral valve interstitial cells and its association with fibromyxomatous valvular disorder. As the expression of certain proteoglycans is elevated in several kidney diseases, we hypothesized that proteoglycans mediate kidney injury in the context of aldosterone/MR pathway activation. We evaluated the proteoglycan expression and tissue injury in the kidney and isolated glomeruli of uninephrectomy/aldosterone/salt (NAS) mice. The MRA eplerenone was administered to assess the role of the MR pathway. We investigated the direct effects of biglycan, one of the proteoglycans, on macrophages using isolated macrophages. The kidney samples from NAS-treated mice showed enhanced fibrosis and increased expression of biglycan accompanying glomerular macrophage infiltration and enhanced expression of TNF-\u03b1, iNOS, Nox2, CCL3 (C-C motif chemokine ligand 3), and phosphorylated NF-\u03baB. Eplerenone blunted these changes. Purified biglycan stimulated macrophages to express TNF-\u03b1, iNOS, Nox2, and CCL3.

On the one hand, people are seen as the creators of their material and mental world through their labour activity. They are endowed with natural human qualities, creative powers and historically existing potentialities that are essential to human growth. People are, in essence, free, creative, productive beings of praxis in conscious control of their activities and the world they have created. But the material and mental products of human labour (e.g. commodities, ideas, social institutions) assume an autonomous life of their own. They come to rule over people as dehumanizing objects and powers, as alien and hostile forces operating independently above and against the common will of their own creators. People no longer experience themselves as active human agents in conscious control of their life circumstances.

However, as the digital transformation phenomenon grows increasingly disruptive, the misalignment of human resources is becoming more apparent as IT professionals are faced with mixed job demands requiring multidisciplinary skillsets. Along with the lack of workforce diversity and high turnover rates, these HRM challenges are impacting career dynamics and talent management practices. A systematic literature review of 20 empirical studies reveals three broad themes: debunking the dual-ladder construct of traditionally opposing technical and management career paths, fostering a diverse workforce through a variety of demographic profiles, and understanding the response strategies of IT professionals. While career anchors proved to be a useful model, it falls short in the context of the current structural changes of professional career choices and talent requirements, which requires a more diverse and dynamic model. This finding leads to a new research agenda emphasizing the study of Business Technology Management (BTM).

Immune Reconstitution and Function by CD4+CD25+ Regulatory T Cells Following Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.}, container_title={Blood}, abstract={Abstract Regulatory T cells (Treg), defined phenotypically by CD4+CD25+ expression, reduce the incidence and severity of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in murine models of major-MHC mismatched hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), presumably by dampening the proliferation and activation of mature effector T cells. It is unclear whether the effect of Treg on effector T cells is a selective or nonselective process or if Treg regulate the process of intrathymic and peripheral T cell maturation and selection following HCT, particularly given the intrinsic link of GvHD and immune reconstitution. The current study assessed the impact of Treg on the quantitative and functional lymphoid reconstitution in a murine model of major-MHC mismatched HCT. Treg (5x105) from the spleen and lymph nodes of FVB/N (H2q) mice were co-transplanted into lethally irradiated Balb/c (H2d) host along with wild-type FVB/N T-cell depleted bone marrow (TCD-BM) cells (5x106) and splenocytes (1.25x106) (Tcon), the latter to induce GvHD. Chimerism studies were performed on day 14 and 40 post-transplantation to measure the level of donor immune reconstitution. At both time points, total lymphoid reconstitution was delayed in the GvHD control group and enhanced in the recipients transplanted with Treg (p-values=0.0005 on day 14, &lt;0.0001 on day 40). T cell reconstitution, particularly CD4+ cells, was enhanced in the Treg group at both time points and reached statistical significance on day 40 (p-value=0.003). The number of donor natural killer cells was particularly enhanced on day 14 in the Treg recipients (p-value=0.0003). B-cell reconstitution, as measured by percentage of CD19+ cells, was minimal for all groups at day 14, but was enhanced at day 40 in recipient animals that received Treg (p-value=0.006). The T cell repertoire assessed by V-beta TCR screening with FACS analysis showed a polyclonal distribution. To determine if the improved and diverse lymphoid reconstitution is associated with increased immune function, mice were challenged with murine CMV (5x10e5 pfu/mouse) intraperitoneally at day 14 post-transplantation. Two weeks after infection, 66% of animals which received Treg in addition to Tcon, and 11% of animals which received Tcon alone were alive (p-value=0.05). Uninfected mice in the respective groups served as controls to separate the effect of CMV infection and GvHD on survival. Compared to infected animals, no deaths were observed in the respective uninfected groups at this time point (Tcon alone, p-value=0.0004; Treg+Tcon, p-value=0.21). In both infected and control uninfected animals, Treg treated animals had no evidence of significant clinical GvHD while animals that received Tcon alone had severe GvHD. These findings indicate that Treg enhance both the quantitative and functional recovery of the lymphoid cell populations while providing protection against GvHD.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0,

To address engagement, we must first understand what standard engagement levels are in the context of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and how these compare with other treatments. Objective This scoping review aims to examine the state of reporting on intervention engagement in RCTs of mobile app\u2013based interventions intended to treat symptoms of depression. We sought to identify what engagement metrics are and are not routinely reported as well as what the metrics that are reported reflect about standard engagement levels. Methods We conducted a systematic search of 7 databases to identify studies meeting our eligibility criteria, namely, RCTs that evaluated use of a mobile app\u2013based intervention in adults, for which depressive symptoms were a primary outcome of interest. We then extracted 2 kinds of information from each article: intervention details and indices of DMHI engagement. A 5-element framework of minimum necessary DMHI engagement reporting was derived by our team and guided our data extraction. This framework included (1) recommended app use as communicated to participants at enrollment and, when reported, app adherence criteria; (2) rate of intervention uptake among those assigned to the intervention; (3) level of app use metrics reported, specifically number of uses and time spent using the app; (4) duration of app use metrics (ie, weekly use patterns); and (5) number of intervention completers. Results Database searching yielded 2083 unique records. Of these, 22 studies were eligible for inclusion. Only 64% (14/22) of studies included in this review specified rate of intervention uptake. Level of use metrics was only reported in 59% (13/22) of the studies reviewed. Approximately one-quarter of the studies (5/22, 23%) reported duration of use metrics. Only half (11/22, 50%) of the studies reported the number of participants who completed the app-based components of the intervention as intended or other metrics related to completion. Findings in those studies reporting metrics related to intervention completion indicated that between 14.4% and 93.0% of participants randomized to a DMHI condition completed the intervention as intended or according to a specified adherence criteria. Conclusions Findings suggest that engagement was underreported and widely varied. It was not uncommon to see completion rates at or below 50% (11/22) of those participants randomized to a treatment condition or to simply see completion rates not reported at all. This variability in reporting suggests a failure to establish sufficient reporting standards and limits the conclusions that can be drawn about level of engagement with DMHIs. Based on these findings, the 5-element framework applied in this review may be useful as a minimum necessary standard for DMHI engagement reporting.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Agronomy and Crop Science\"]", "language": "en", "length": [104, 29, 0], "string": "title={Chitosan enhances withanolides production in adventitious root cultures of Withania somnifera (L.)

abstract={Linseed mucilage has been separated into an acidic and a neutral fraction. The acidic fraction was further separated, by the use of cupric acetate solution, into two fractions, CuI and CuII. Fraction CuI contained L-rhamnose, L-galactose, and D-galacturonic acid. The methylated reduced polysaccharide gave on hydrolysis 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-L-rhamnose, 3,4-di-O-methyl-L-rhamnose, 4-O-methyl-L-rhamnose, 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methyl-D-galactose, 2,3,6-tri-O-methyl-D-galactose, and 2,3-di-O-methyl-D-galactose (?); L-galactose was lost during the methylation process. Periodate oxidation studies on the material indicated that the polymer was composed of a main chain of L-rhamnose units with most of the L-galactose units attached as non-reducing end groups. Fraction CuII contained L-rhamnose, L-fucose, L-galactose, and D-galacturonic acid. The methylated reduced polysaccharide gave on hydrolysis 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-L-fucose, 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methyl-L-galactose, 2,3,6-tri-O-methyl-D-galactose, 4-O-methyl-L-rhamnose, L-rhamnose, and possibly 2,3-di-O-methyl-D-galactose and 3-O-methyl-D-galactose. Periodate oxidation studies and a degradation by the Smith procedure indicated the presence of a L-rhamnose backbone with L-fucose and L-galactose units attached as non-reducing end groups.The neutral fraction yielded a periodate-oxidizable material after one Smith-type degradation. Periodate oxidation studies indicated that the degraded material was branched. Methylation of the degraded polysaccharide followed by hydrolysis yielded 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-D-xylose, 2,3-di-O-methyl-D-xylose, 2,4-di-O-methyl-D-xylose, 4-O-methyl-D-xylose, D-xylose, and traces of 2,3,4-trt-O-methyl- or 2,5-di-O-methyl-L-arabinose, 2,4-di-O-methyl-D-xylose, and 3-O-methyl-D-xylose. The main backbone of the degraded polysaccharide appeared to consist of (1 \u2192 4)-linked D-xylose units. Linkages of the (1 \u2192 3) type were also present. The smaller fragments from the Smith-type degradation, L-arabinose, 2-O-\u03b1-L-arabinosyl glycerol, and glycerol were characterized. A partial acid hydrolysis of the neutral fraction yielded a number of oligosaccharides.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

parameters based on the surrogate model and the trajectory simulation system of the 3-DOF air-launched rockets were established. The Gaussian kernel width determination method based on the relationship between local density and width is used to ensure the efficiency and reliability of the optimization method, and at the same time greatly reduces the amount of calculation. An adaptive sampling point updating method was established, which includes three stages: location sampling, exploration sampling, and potential optimal sampling of the potential feasible region. The adaptive sampling is realized by the distance constraint. Based on the precision of the surrogate model, the convergence end criterion was established, which can achieve efficient and reliable probabilistic global optimization. The objective function of the optimization problem was deduced to determine the maximum load mass and reasonable constraints were set to ensure that the rocket could successfully enter orbit. For solid engine rockets with the same take-off mass as Launcherone, the launch altitude and target orbit were optimized and analyzed, and verified by 3-DOF trajectory simulation. The surrogate-based optimization algorithm solved the problem of the overall parameter design optimization of the air-launched rocket and it provides support for the design of air-launched solid

Acredita-se que o c\u00e1lcio seja capaz de retardar a senesc\u00eancia e manter a firmeza dos frutos. O objetivo do presente trabalho foi de ampliar o per\u00edodo de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o p\u00f3s-colheita de jabuticabas, por meio de sua imers\u00e3o em solu\u00e7\u00e3o de CaCl2. Os frutos foram colhidos completamente maduros em pomar da UFV, imersos em solu\u00e7\u00e3o de CaCl2 40 g.L-1 por 0; 5; 10; 20; 40 e 60 minutos e mantidos \u00e0 temperatura e umidade relativa ambientes por seis dias. Maiores tempos de imers\u00e3o resultaram em maior reten\u00e7\u00e3o de firmeza dos frutos, embora sem afetar a perda de mat\u00e9ria fresca dos mesmos. Houve, em todos os tempos de imers\u00e3o usados, redu\u00e7\u00e3o da firmeza e aumento da perda de mat\u00e9ria fresca dos frutos com o aumento do per\u00edodo de armazenagem. A taxa respirat\u00f3ria reduziu-se com o aumento do tempo de imers\u00e3o. A taxa respirat\u00f3ria tamb\u00e9m foi decrescente, em todos os tempos de imers\u00e3o, de 0 a 4 dias ap\u00f3s a colheita, aumentando desse dia em diante. A acidez da polpa aumentou durante o armazenamento. Esta reduziu-se suavemente quando os tempos de imers\u00e3o em CaCl2 variaram de 0 a 20 min e aumentou nos frutos imersos por 40 e 60 min.

A citation index is \u2018an ordered list of cited articles each of which is accompanied by a list of citing articles.

Illness in Paramedicine: A Model for Future Practice}, container_title={}, abstract={Introduction Mental health presentations are a rapidly growing proportion of cases seen by paramedics, often at the frontline of care delivery. How paramedics perceive persons with mental illness is vital, as their experiences in providing care can significantly impact decision-making. This article investigates these experiences and how they may influence patient care. Methods This qualitative descriptive research was conducted with two focus groups of six operational paramedics, and the data recorded and transcribed. The team closely examined the data using thematic analysis through a symbolic interactionist lens to identify, analyse, and interpret patterns of meaning within transcribed data. After thematic analysis, a model for future practice was generated, which pictorially demonstrates the overlap of common themes. Results Five themes ultimately were identified that were profoundly important to the paramedics within the focus groups. Paramedics have varying experiences when caring for people with mental illness. They are empathetic towards the circumstances of the person with mental illness. They perceive that the Stigmatisation of persons with mental illness occurs in some cases. Paramedics are also affected in their clinical decision-making by their training and education and by the profession's cultural influences. Conclusion The Stigmatisation of people with mental illness is apparent in paramedic practice. Despite mental illness being a common presenting problem, paramedics feel underprepared and have difficulty treating those who need help. The patients\u2019 behaviour can often be reflected in the conduct of paramedics. The impact of burnout due to high exposure to people with mental illness, especially in metropolitan areas, may lead to decreased levels of empathy and compassion.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0,

and wind stress patterns. The dominant regional trends are high rates in the western tropical Pacific and minimal to negative rates in the eastern Pacific, particularly off North America. Interannual sea level variations associated with El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation events do not account for these trends. In the western tropical Pacific, tide gauge records indicate that the recent high rates represent a significant trend increase in the early 1990s relative to the preceding 40 years. This sea level trend shift in the western Pacific corresponds to an intensification of the easterly trade winds across the tropical Pacific. The wind change appears to be distinct from climate variations centered in the North Pacific, such as the Pacific decadal oscillation. In the eastern Pacific, tide gauge records exhibit higher-amplitude decadal fluctuations than in the western tropical Pacific, and the recent negative sea level trends are indistinguishable from these fluctuations. The shifts in trade wind strength and western Pacific sea level rate resemble changes in dominant global modes of outgoing longwave radiation and sea surface temperature. It is speculated that the western Pacific sea level response indicates a general strengthening of the atmospheric circulation over the tropical Pacific since the early 1990s that has developed in concert with recent warming trends.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Attribution Test for Children (IAC)}, container_title={Assessment}, abstract={The Intention Attribution Test for Children (IAC) was created to assess hostile attribution bias in preschool- and early school-aged children. It comprises 16 cartoon strips presenting situations in which one character (either a child or an adult) causes harm to another, either intentionally, accidentally (nonintentional), or without his or her intention being clear (ambiguous). Its validity was tested on 233 children aged 4 to 12 years. Exploratory factor analysis and item response theory models demonstrated support for a single factor of hostile attribution bias for the ambiguous and nonintentional items. Analyses revealed, however, that the intentional items did not contribute to this same overall construct of hostile intention attribution bias. Correlations with the Social Perception Test and with sociometry suggest good validity of the IAC.

Para ello, se realiz\u00f3 una b\u00fasqueda bibliogr\u00e1fica en Web of Science (colecci\u00f3n principal), Scopus, Medline, Psycinfo, Cochrane, Teseo, Psicodoc y Scielo, de documentos publicados hasta el a\u00f1o 2018 (incluido). Un total de 43 documentos cumplieron con los criterios de inclusi\u00f3n y por tanto fueron analizados en la presente revisi\u00f3n. En estos resultados se observ\u00f3 que el trastorno del humor (afectivo) suele ser el m\u00e1s frecuente en esta poblaci\u00f3n y dentro de las experiencias traum\u00e1ticas primaron el abuso sexual y haber sufrido diferentes tipos de experiencias traum\u00e1ticas.

abstract={Abstract This paper presents a set of files for working with Topas software in order to calculate the thermal expansion coefficients of a crystal phase as a function of the temperature from a set of powder diffractograms. All the calculations and profile fittings are performed in the same run, in cascade and without interruption. Free graphics software GNUPLOT reads the output files in order to display both the characteristic three-dimensional thermal expansion surface and any section of this surface. The results are also generated as text files. The files also calculate the thermal expansion coefficients in any [u, v, w] direction and at any temperature, and the angles between the principal axes and the crystallographic axes. The user can modify the input text files to their requirements.

Optimizing cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and angiogenesis, and providing suitable stromal support and signalling cues are keys to successfully generating clinically useful tissues. Interestingly, those components are often subverted in the cancer setting, where aberrant angiogenesis, cellular proliferation, cell signalling and resistance to apoptosis drive malignant growth. In contrast to tissue engineering, identifying and inhibiting those pathways is a major challenge in cancer research. The recent discovery of adult tissue-specific stem cells has had a major impact on both tissue engineering and cancer research. The unique properties of these cells and their role in tissue and organ repair and regeneration hold great potential for engineering tissue-specific constructs. The emerging body of evidence implicating stem cells and progenitor cells as the source of oncogenic transformation prompts caution when using these cells for tissue-engineering purposes. While tissue engineering and cancer research may be considered as opposed fields of research with regard to their proclaimed goals, the compelling overlap in fundamental pathways underlying these processes suggests that cross-disciplinary research will benefit both fields.

Study Design: Experimental animal study. Methods: A canine laryngeal model was used to assess the acute and sustained efficacy of a lateral cricoarytenoid (LCA) muscle release. A total of 34 canine hemilaryngeal preparations were divided among 7 experimental groups. The LCA muscle was separated from its cricoid cartilage origin via an open, anterior, submucosal approach. The laryngeal adductory pressures (LAP) were assessed pre- and post-muscle release via direct recurrent laryngeal nerve stimulation. Measurements were repeated at 1.5, 3, or 6 months postoperatively. Another study evaluated release of the thyroarytenoid (TA) muscle from its thyroid cartilage origin. Results: Releasing the LCA muscle demonstrated a significant decrease in LAP acutely and was maintained at all 3 time points with the aid of a barrier ( P Conclusions: The proposed LCA release procedure may provide patients with a permanent treatment option for ADSD.

dependent in gonadally intact than in ovariectomized female cats}, container_title={}, abstract={Using gonadally intact female cats, we showed previously that estrogen, applied topically to the spinal cord, attenuated the exercise pressor reflex. Although the mechanism by which estrogen exerted its attenuating effect is unknown, this steroid hormone has been shown to influence spinal opioid pathways, which in turn have been implicated in the regulation of the exercise pressor reflex. These findings prompted us to test the hypothesis that opioids mediate the attenuating effect of estrogen on the exercise pressor reflex in both gonadally intact female and ovariectomized cats. We therefore applied 200 \u03bcl of 17\u03b2-estradiol (0.01 \u03bcg/ml) with and without the addition of 1,000 \u03bcg naloxone, a \u03bc- and \u03b4-opioid antagonist, to a spinal well covering the L6\u2013S1 spinal cord in decerebrated female cats that were either gonadally intact or ovariectomized. The exercise pressor reflex was evoked by electrical stimulation of the L7 or S1 ventral root, a maneuver that caused the hindlimb muscles to contract statically. We found that, in gonadally intact cats, the attenuating effect of estrogen was more pronounced than that in ovariectomized cats. We also found that, in gonadally intact female cats, naloxone partly reversed the attenuation of the pressor response to static contraction caused by spinal estrogen application. For example, in intact cats, the pressor response to contraction before estrogen application averaged 39 \u00b1 4 mmHg ( n = 10), whereas the pressor response 60 min afterward averaged only 18 \u00b1 4 mmHg ( P}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Electrical and Electronic Engineering\"]", "language": "en", "length": [77, 35, 0], "string": "title={Pareto-Optimal Resource Allocation in Decentralized Wireless Powered Networks}, container_title={IEEE Transactions on Communications}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Applied Mathematics\", \"Electrical and Electronic Engineering\", \"Computer Science Applications\"]", "language": "en", "length": [79, 44, 0], "string": "title={ZigBee-Assisted Power Saving for More Efficient and Sustainable Ad Hoc Networks}, container_title={IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cell Biology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [140, 0, 1846], "string": "title={NH2-Terminal Targeting Motifs Direct Dual Specificity A-Kinase\u2013anchoring Protein 1 (D-AKAP1) to Either Mitochondria or Endoplasmic Reticulum}, container_title={}, abstract={Subcellular localization directed by specific targeting motifs is an emerging theme for regulating signal transduction pathways. For cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), this is achieved primarily by its association with A-kinase\u2013anchoring proteins (AKAPs). Dual specificity AKAP1, (D-AKAP1) binds to both type I and type II regulatory subunits and has two NH2-terminal (N0 and N1) and two COOH-terminal (C1 and C2) splice variants (Huang et al., 1997. J. Biol. Chem. 272:8057). Here we report that the splice variants of D-AKAP1 are expressed in a tissue-specific manner with the NH2-terminal motifs serving as switches to localize D-AKAP1 at different sites. Northern blots showed that the N1 splice is expressed primarily in liver, while the C1 splice is predominant in testis. The C2 splice shows a general expression pattern. Microinjecting expression constructs of D-AKAP1(N0) epitope-tagged at either the NH2 or the COOH terminus showed their localization to the mitochondria based on immunocytochemistry. Deletion of N0(1-30) abolished mitochondrial targeting while N0(1-30)-GFP localized to mitochondria. Residues 1\u201330 of N0 are therefore necessary and sufficient for mitochondria targeting. Addition of the 33 residues of N1 targets D-AKAP1 to the ER and residues 1\u201363 fused to GFP are necessary and sufficient for ER targeting. Residues 14\u201333 of N1 are especially important for targeting to ER; however, residues 1\u201333 alone fused to GFP gave a diffuse distribution. N1(14-33) thus serves two functions: (a) it suppresses the mitochondrial-targeting motif located within residues 1\u201330 of N0 and (b) it exposes an ER-targeting motif that is at least partially contained within the N0(1-30) motif. This represents the first example of a differentially targeted AKAP and adds an additional level of complexity to the PKA signaling network.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

With the objective of validating the simulation model used to derive its response matrix, irradiations in reference monoenergetic fields were performed at National Physical Laboratory (UK). As the energy distributions of neutron beams in NCT extend from keV to a few MeV, monoenergetic fields in this domain were chosen, namely 71.5 keV, 144.2 keV, 565.1 keV, 841.9 keV and 1200.4 keV.

While much extant literature uses a deductive approach for identifying guest satisfaction dimensions, we apply an inductive approach by utilizing large unstructured text data of 104,161 online reviews of Korean accommodation customers to frame which topics of interest guests find important. Using latent Dirichlet allocation, a generative, Bayesian, hierarchical statistical model, we extract and validate topics of interest in the dataset. The results corroborate extant literature in that dimensions, such as location and service quality, are important. However, we extend existing dimensions of importance by more precisely distinguishing aspects of location and service quality. Furthermore, by comparing the characteristics of the accommodations in terms of metropolitan versus rural and the type of accommodation, we reveal differences in topics of importance between different characteristics of the accommodations. Specifically, we find a higher importance for points of competition and points of uniqueness among the accommodation characteristics. This has implications for how managers can improve customer satisfaction and how researchers can more precisely measure customer satisfaction in the hospitality industry.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0,

Burrowing is generally categorized into two groups: forward-burrowing and backward-burrowing. While forward-burrowing is more rare than backward-burrowing, we show that it has evolved independently at least eight times across anurans and is correlated with distinct features of the external and internal anatomy. The shape of the humerus is especially important for forward-burrowing, as many species use their forelimbs for digging. Using X-ray computed tomography data, we characterize shape variation in the humerus, including three-dimensional (3D) morphometrics, assess the morphology of muscles related to this variation in the humerus, and discuss the mechanical and evolutionary consequences of our results. We show that the humeri of most forward-burrowing frogs are morphologically distinct from those of non-forward-burrowers, including features such as a curved and thick diaphysis, the presence of a pronounced ventral crest, and relatively large epicondyles and humeral head.

Cell Disease}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Hydroxyurea therapy is associated with reduced morbidity among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Avascular necrosis of the femoral head (AVN) is one potentially debilitating complication of SCD. In this study, we examined the relationship between hydroxyurea use and the prevalence of AVN among children with SCD. We performed a retrospective chart review of 202 children with SCD, aged 10\u201321 years, followed in the pediatric hematology program at the Children\u2019s Hospital at Montefiore (Bronx, NY) between July 2007 and 2008. Abstracted data included age, ethnicity, SCD genotype, frequency of hospitalization, hip radiograph results, laboratory data and hydroxyurea use. Hip radiographs were performed prospectively as part of SCD health maintenance from 2005\u20132008. Forty-four patients were excluded because they did not have a screening hip radiograph. Descriptive statistics were calculated for independent variables. T-tests and chi-square tests were used to compare clinical and demographic characteristics of children with and without AVN. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to estimate the odds ratio of having AVN among SCD patients. Our final sample consisted of 158 patients whose demographic characteristics are listed in Table 1. The prevalence of AVN was 16.5% (n=26). Of the clinical variables analyzed, we identified significant associations between the presence of AVN and hydroxyurea use (p=.005), as well as older age (p=.013) (Table 1.) Children with AVN had significantly lower mean lactic dehydrogenase levels (LDH) (p=.04) and higher mean corpuscular volumes (MCV) (p=.012). (Table 2.) After controlling for gender, ethnicity, sickle cell genotype, and frequency of hospitalizations, age was also found to be associated with AVN (OR 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01,1.31, p=0.033). SCD patients on hydroxyurea had higher odds of having AVN compared to non-users (OR 3.51, 95% CI: 1.31, 9.38, p= 0.013). Laboratory values (MCV, Hemoglobin, LDH and Hematocrit) had a high degree of collinearity and were removed from the final model. In summary, the prevalence of AVN in our sample was 16.5%. This is substantially higher than the prevalence of approximately 6% reported by the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease for comparative age groups in a prospective study1. SCD patients exposed to hydroxyurea were three times more likely to have AVN than those not exposed to this drug. Vaso-occlusive pain crisis is a recognized risk factor for AVN, thus we could expect a higher rate of AVN among patients on hydroxyurea. However, the odds ratio of 3.5 is unexpectedly high and warrants further investigation into the role of hydroxyurea as a risk factor for AVN. Nonetheless, these preliminary results suggest that more stringent screening regimens for AVN may be indicated among this subset of patients. Table 1.

container_title={Nutrire}, abstract={Abstract Background Western diet and sedentary life are imputed for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Relationship of obesity and bright liver, i.e., the ultrasound hallmarks of fatty liver, evaluated as Bright Liver Score (BLS), with Western diet pattern score (WDS) and with the level of physical exercise, assessed by the Baecke questionnaire, were investigated. Methods One hundred fifty (72 females, 78 males) NAFLD non-diabetic patients, 47.89 \u00b1 13.85 years old, were referred to a diagnostic-therapeutic unit with the lone evidence of fatty liver as detected by an ultrasound. WDS, Adherence to Mediterranean Diet Score (AMDS), physical exercise, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and BMI were assessed also after 6 months of comprehensive lifestyle intervention. Results BLS, BMI, HOMA, and WDS were significantly greater, while AMDS and physical exercise were lower at the greater severity of ultrasound (US)-detected NAFLD. Positive linear correlation of WDS, BMI, and HOMA vs. BLS was present at patients\u2019 referral. After intervention, decrease of liver dimension and of Bright Liver Score concurrent with a reduction of BMI, HOMA-IR, WDS, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides was observed. A reciprocal increase of AMDS, physical exercise, and HDL cholesterol was also reported. Conclusions The assessment of some features of the Western diet is possible; its effect, along with overweight, is associated with a greater severity of fatty liver as evaluated by ultrasound in NAFLD.

of a multi-layer field, including tens and hundreds of oil-bearing horizons and local deposits, combined with their vertical and horizontal separation, creates conditions for the formation of residual oil reserves. For the purpose of identifying and spatial localization of residual reserves, an algorithm for retrospective analysis was developed and applied on the example of the Upper and Lower Devonian terrigenous deposits of the Romashkinskoe oil field, which have been developed since 1952. The long history of geological study and development of oil-bearing formations of the Pashiysky D1 (layers g and e), Mullinsky D2, Ardatovsky D3, Vorobyevsky D4 and Biysky D5 horizons is analyzed according to the data of 2605 wells. It is proposed to single out 6 categories of formations and the reserves contained in them. Previously undeveloped formations composed of conditioned reservoirs are classified as category 1. Formations composed of more clayey and less permeable reservoirs are awarded with category 2. Category 3 includes previously developed formations, but left before reaching the limit of water cut, and category 4 \u2013 currently being developed intervals. The least promising are those that are stopped after reaching the maximum water cut (category 5), as well as wedged out, replaced by non-reservoirs or considered water-bearing (category 6) formations. Categories were mapped to identify, visualize and describe the main patterns in the distribution of residual reserves, which are established both in single wells and in bypassed oil that include a group of wells. The algorithm was tested on the corporate information base of historical data on geological exploration, research and development of the Abdrakhmanovskaya area of \u200b\u200bthe Romashkinskoe oil field. Examples of experimental workover operations to include the identified residual reserves in the development are given.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) have been hypothesized to impact vascular health, however the association between ENDS and CACs is unknown. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that ENDS use, sole or dual, will be significantly associated with CAC levels. Methods: We analyzed CAC levels of 314 human participants enrolled in the Cardiovascular Injury due to Tobacco Use study, which is a multi-center cross-sectional study of healthy participants 21-45 years age, without known cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular disease risk factors. Four study groups were determined a priori - non-smokers (n=62), sole cigarette users (n=207), sole ENDS users (n=17), and dual users (cigarette and ENDS) (n=28). A total of 15 CACs were measured via a standardized flowcytometry protocol using four cell surface markers - CD146 (endothelial), CD34 (stem cell), CD45 (leukocyte), and ACC133 (early progenitor/stem cell). Regression analysis was conducted using a General Linear Model with gamma distribution and log-link. Model was adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity, and enrollment site. Results: Among sole ENDS users, two CACs were significantly higher and four CACs were significantly lower, as compared to referent non-smokers (all P Conclusion: CACs are sensitive to ENDS use, including dual use. Although CACs with endothelial surface markers were most commonly associated with ENDS/dual use, CACs with stem and early progenitor surface markers were also associated with ENDS/dual use. CACs are promising biomarkers of vascular function and further research is needed to quantify the effect of individual CAC on vascular function.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Documentation}, container_title={}, abstract={Background: The documentation of medical records of diabetic patients is very important for the treatment of diabetes. The purpose of this study was to conduct quantitative evaluations of the Diabetic Medical Record (DMR) and Documentation Completeness Rate (DCR). Methods: In this retrospective study, we evaluated the DCR of DMRs in the Comprehensive Diabetes Center of Imam Reza Hospital (CDRIRH). A checklist was prepared to evaluate the DCR. The overall assessment of the DCR was represented according to the following rating: 95\u2013100% as strong, 75\u201394% as moderate, and less than 75% as weak. The free texts that physicians recorded in the DMRs were extracted to identify the data elements that physicians must record. In addition, the clinical importance of the data elements of the DMRs from the perspective of the endocrinologists was determined and then compared with the DCR. Results: In this study, 1,200 DMRs and DCRs for 50 data elements in eight major categories were evaluated. The total DCR average was 30% and data elements in the laboratory test results category demonstrated the highest DCR (50.5%), whereas the least percentage was demonstrated in the internal visits category. The DCR for the other main categories was: demographic information = 48.5%; patient referral information = 14.2%; diagnosis = 5%; anti-hyperglycemic medications = 25.5%; diabetic complications = 17.7%; and results of specialty and subspecialty consultation = 41.7%.

Learning from the MDGs Experience}, container_title={Social Indicators Research}, abstract={AbstractThis paper contributes to the debate on the Sustainable Development Goals progress by evaluating the MDGs achievements in South Asia and the policy and institutional challenges deriving from such experience. Using cross-country regressions and aggregate indicators of poverty, health, education and gender parity outcomes, we offer three sets of findings. First, comparative evidence shows that, while South Asia has converged with richer regions, there is still significant variation in gender equality, universal primary education, and income poverty achievements across countries. Second, projections based on past trends on where SDGs are expected to be by 2030 reveal that there is a long way to go, where emblematic targets as income poverty eradication may not be met in the populous South Asian countries. Finally, considering the expanded set of development targets in the SDGs and the growth slowdown in South Asia, we argue that further progress would simultaneously require increased public spending on health and education and reforms improving state capacity. A simulation exercise confirms that such a combination of interventions would deliver significant benefits in the region, particularly in areas that are critical to progress on the goals of \u2018No

in the framework of f(R, T) gravity theory, applying it on a spherically symmetric and static charged isotropic matter distribution. Specifically, the well\u2013known Krori\u2013Barua toy model is translated to an anisotropic domain by deforming the complete space\u2013time. To do so, the so\u2013called \u03b8\u2013sector has been solved by using the mimic constraint for the radial pressure and a general equation of state relating the components of the \u03b8 \u03bc \u03bd source. A thoroughly study on the main salient features of the output such as density, radial pressure, transverse pressure and anisotropy factor is performed to check the feasibility of the model, in order to determine whether this structure can represent real celestial bodies such as neutron stars. Furthermore, the consequences of e\u2013MGD on some relevant astrophysical parameters, that is, the total mass M, gravitational redshift z and time dilation d \u03c4 around the object are explored. It is found that the maximum mass provided by this toy model is M = 2.506M \u2299, corresponding to the massive neutron stars.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

This essay analyzes the rhetoric and imagery of historical extinctions as seen in these memorials to understand the ways people struggled to understand the loss. Through examination of memorials to extinct species in U.S. museums, parks, and zoos my research has revealed a continuous struggle to identify the personhood of animals, define human-animal interactions, and locate human responsibility for environmental change. While each memorial mimics remembrance practices used for humans and human events, they differ in their acknowledgement of the individuality and the agency of its extinction which, in turn, often denies agency to the animal. Steeped as they are in Romantic-era notions of wildness, these memorials can be read as parables of environmentalism, but in their conceptualization of the animal, they instruct us in the varieties of human-animal interactions and representations within the environmental movement at different times and places, making them more complex spaces than their simplicity suggests. While memorials present only a slice of the story, the memories they create and reinforce become part of the cultural ways of dealing with extinction that is often more popular and more poignant than historical narratives documenting their declines. At its core, my research adds to the literature on constructions of Nature in American culture by connecting 19th-century declension narratives with 20th-century extinctions, and problematizes the American ideology of abundance.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Urology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [32, 0, 0], "string": "title={Editorial: Renal Transplantation}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Mechanical Engineering\", \"Mechanics of Materials\", \"Condensed Matter Physics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [62, 28, 870], "string": "title={Amplitude Modulation of a Forced System by Parameter Variation}, container_title={Journal of Applied Mechanics}, abstract={Classical (primary) parametric amplification is reviewed.

However, immune rejection and insufficient methods for cell fate tracing compromise the assessment of graft efficiency and survival. Hence, we sought to establish a hiPSC line for regenerative therapies which combines hypoimmunogenic and in vivo traceable features. Methods: A hiPSC line was modified using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to first insert a tdTomato reporter into the MLC2v gene and in a second step to replace exons 2 and 3 of the B2M gene with a neomycin resistance cassette, designated B2M-KO. MHC-I surface expression was evaluated by flow cytometry analysis. The immune response of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells against the B2M-KO and wild-type hiPSCs was evaluated with a lactate dehydrogenase-based cytotoxicity assay. Immunocytochemistry and qRT-PCR expression analyses were performed to study the cardiomyogenic capacity of B2M-KO hiPSCs during directed cardiac differentiation. Results: The homozygous disruption of the B2M gene was confirmed by qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. However, mRNA expression of essential cardiac transcription factors ( NKX2.5, TBX5 ) and important structural genes ( MLC2a, MLC2v ) during cardiac differentiation was not affected. By contrast, CD8+ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity against B2M -deficient hiPSCs was dramatically reduced compared to wild-type hiPSCs (ptdTomato fluorescence in differentiating B2M -deficient hiPSCs was generally detectable around day 20 of the directed cardiac differentiation protocol and increased over time. These cells concomitantly also showed expression of MLC2v . Finally, immunocytochemistry confirmed expression of MLC2a, MLC2v and \u03b1-ACTININ similar to unedited cells after 30 days of cardiac differentiation. Conclusions: Genetic manipulation of MHC-I surface expression is an efficient strategy to reduce T cell-mediated immune rejection, yet unable to decrease NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The generated B2M-KO hiPSC line exhibits hypoimmunogenic properties and allows post-transplantational in vivo tracking of ventricular cardiomyocytes.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Dynamic three dimensional gradient-recalled-echo MR imaging provides dynamic contrast-enhanced thin-section images with fat saturation and a high signal-to-noise ratio and is excellent for the evaluation of various focal hepatic lesions. Aim: To explore the effectiveness and hence the clinical utility of plain and contrast MR characterisation of focal hepatic lesions in patients and their correlation with the histopathological findings. Materials and Methods: The present study was a multicenteric study done on both Inpatients and Outpatients of Department of Radiology of Tertiary care hospitals in Bengaluru, from January 2020 to August 2020. A total of 42 patients diagnosed with focal liver lesions by Ultrasonography were included in this study. Plain MRI study was done by using spin echo technique and contrast MRI study was done after rapid bolus injection (0.1 mmol/kg body weight) of gadolinium dimeglumine. Pathological and post-operative histopathological findings were noted. Microsoft excel software was used for data analysis and tables were prepared for comparison of collected data. Specificity and sensitivity were calculated for diagnostic accuracy of MRI. Results: This study included forty-two patients in total, twenty-five male and seventeen female patients, in age group of 15 to 84 years with a mean age of 48 years. Metastasis and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) were most common malignant lesions in liver while Hemangiomas were most common benign lesions followed by simple and complex cysts and hepatic adenoma. The present study calculated the specificity and sensitivity of MRI of focal hepatic lesions and correlated the findings clinically, pathologically and histopathologically. The specificity of MRI for characterisation of focal liver disease was high (90.4%). Specificity of MRI for HCC was found to be 96.7 % and that for metastasis was 97% while sensitivity for Haemangiomas is found to be 100%.MRI is superior compared to other modalities like ultrasound and CT in having high spatial resolution. Multiple sequences like T1, T2 and fat suppression techniques like IN PHASE, OUT OF PHASE helps in demonstrating lesion characters like architecture, margin, haemorrhage, fat component and vascular invasion of the lesions. Conclusion: MRI is valuable for the characterization of focal liver lesions detected on Ultrasonography. Basic MRI sequences along with chemical shift imaging sequences and dynamic contrast imaging has significant role in characterising the focal liver lesions. Despite that, It should be the modality choice for the lesions which are undetected or doubtful on ultrasound and CT examinations.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

inbred lines for drought tolerance}, container_title={}, abstract={Drought is a severe threat to maize yield stability in Serbia and other temperate Southeast European countries occurring occasionally but with significant yield losses. The development of resilient genotypes that perform well under drought is one of the main focuses of maize breeding programmes. To test the tolerance of newly developed elite maize inbred lines to drought stress, field trials for grain yield performance and anthesis silk interval (ASI) were set in drought stressed environments in 2011 and 2012. Inbred lines performing well under drought, clustered into a group with short ASI and a smaller group with long ASI, were considered as a potential source for tolerance. The former contained inbreds from different heterotic groups and with a proportion of local germplasm. The latter consisted of genotypes with mixed exotic and Lancaster germplasm, which performed better in more drought-affected environments. Three inbreds were selected for their potential drought tolerance, showing an above-average yield and small ASI in all environments. Association analysis indicated significant correlations between ASI and grain yield and three microsatellites (bnlg1525, bnlg238 and umc1025). Eight alleles were selected for their favourable concurrent effect on yield increase and ASI decrease. The proportion of phenotypic variation explained by the markers varied across environments from 5.7% to 22.4% and from 4.6% to 8.1% for ASI and yield, respectively.

This study evaluated patient and treatment characteristics that contributed to hematologic toxicity in older cancer patients. Methods: A prospective study of 115 randomly selected U.S. community oncology practices was undertaken between March 2002 and March 2005 that included 999 consecutive patients age 70 and older. Major malignancies included cancers of lung (26%), colorectal (15%), lymphoma (13%), breast (13%), ovary (9%), genitourinary (7%), other gastrointestinal (6%), other gynecologic (3%) and head and neck (2%). Primary outcome measures included: anemia (Hgb &lt;10 gm/dL), thrombocytopenia (plts &lt;75k/mm3), severe neutropenia (SN) (neutrophils &lt;500 cells/mm3, or WBC count &lt;1000/mm3), febrile neutropenia (FN) and both planned and actual relative dose intensity (RDI) compared to standard regimens. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to compare the difference among patients age 70\u201374 (45%), 75\u201379 (34%), \u2265 80 (21%). Results: Increasing age was associated with lower actual RDI (P&lt;001), although planned RDI did not differ among age groups. Along with reduced actual RDI in elderly patients, progressively fewer SN or FN events (25%, 24%, and 16%, respectively) occurred across chemotherapy cycles (P=0.036). More advanced stage of disease at the time of treatment was associated with fewer SN or FN events in all cycles (35%, 27%, 21%, and 19% for stages 1\u20134, respectively) (P=0.017) along with lower RDI (P=.041). Use of taxane-containing regimens decreased with advancing age (37%, 34%, 27%, respectively) (P=0.034). Among the 50% of patients receiving \u2265 85% RDI, there was no significant difference in SN or FN based on age group or stage. Use of anthracycline-containing regimens was associated with development of SN or FN compared to non-anthracycline regimens (P&lt;0.001). Older patients who received \u2265 85% actual RDI experienced more frequent SN or FN in all cycles of chemotherapy (27%) compared with patients who received &lt;85% (22%) (P=.041) although no significant increase with age was observed. There was no statistically significant difference in anemia or thrombocytopenia among the different age groups. Anemia and thrombocytopenia were more prevalent in older patients receiving an anthracycline or platinum-containing regimen. In multivariate analysis, lower risk of SN or FN remained significantly associated with increasing age (P=.044) after adjustment for stage (P=.115) and actual RDI (P=.066). Prophylactic colony-stimulating factor was used in 5% of patients with no significant difference observed among the age groups. Conclusion: This report represents one of the largest studies to date of elderly cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Neutropenic events increased with actual RDI while decreasing with age and disease stage. Advancing age alone does not appear to increase the risk of hematologic toxicity in older patients receiving full dose intensity chemotherapy. Nevertheless, half of elderly patients in this study received major reductions in actual dose intensity. More information is needed on the impact of reduced dose intensity chemotherapy on long term clinical outcomes in this population.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Earlier reports showed that these cells are capable of correctly expressing heterologous proteins after injecting the corresponding mRNA or cDNA. More recently, the Xenopus oocyte has become an outstanding host\u2013cell model to carry out detailed studies on the function of fully-processed foreign membrane proteins after their microtransplantation to the oocyte. This review focused on the latter overall process of transplanting foreign membrane proteins to the oocyte after injecting plasma membranes or purified and reconstituted proteins. This experimental approach allows for the study of both the function of mature proteins, with their native stoichiometry and post-translational modifications, and their putative modulation by surrounding lipids, mostly when the protein is purified and reconstituted in lipid matrices of defined composition. Remarkably, this methodology enables functional microtransplantation to the oocyte of membrane receptors, ion channels, and transporters from different sources including human post-mortem tissue banks. Despite the large progress achieved over the last decades on the structure, function, and modulation of neuroreceptors and ion channels in healthy and pathological tissues, many unanswered questions remain and, most likely, Xenopus oocytes will continue to help provide valuable responses.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Horticulture\", \"Plant Science\", \"Agronomy and Crop Science\"]", "language": "en", "length": [94, 0, 2052], "string": "title={Stomatal conductance and CO2 assimilation as screening tools for drought resistance in sorghum}, container_title={}, abstract={Stomatal conductance and CO2 assimilation were evaluated at three different levels of soil water availability as tools for estimating relative drought resistance in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.)

Four genotypes differing in drought resistance in the field (A Texas line TX 622; Oklahoma lines, BOK 11 and BOK 111; and IN-15, a line from the Sudan of Africa) were investigated. Plants were grown in a growth chamber at 27 \u00b0C, (day/night) day length of 14 h and photosynthetic photon flux density of 350 \u03bcmol m\u22122 S\u22121. Three weeks after germination, plants were divided into control, 50% and 25% soil water saturation groups. At the end of the second week of treatment, simultaneous measurements were made of stomatal conductance, CO2 assimilation, leaf water potential and transpiration, on the youngest most mature leaf. After gas exchange measurements were taken, leaf water potential was measured. In a separate experiment, survival rate under water stress conditions was also determined on plants grown under the same conditions as above. Four weeks after germination, the plants were subjected to two cycles of drought and the survival rate and growth of each genotype determined. Survival rate and growth throughout dought cycles I and II was, in the decreasing order of, IN-15, BOK 111, TX 622 and BOK 11. Water potential, stomatal conductance and CO2 assimilation of each genotype declined with decreased soil water availability; the smallest decrease was observed in IN-15 and the largest decreases in BOK 111, followed by TX 622 and BOK 11. Water use efficiency of each genotype was increased, in the same order as above, with decreased soil water availability. This correlates with the ranking obtained in the artificial drought test.

The preservation of C. novyi 198 as spores requires a special liquid medium containing insoluble calcium chloride casein (CChC). At present, there is no reference standard available on the Russian market for the quality control of CChC used as a component of the media for preservation of C. novyi 198.The aim of the study was to develop and certify the first batch of calcium chloride casein industry reference standard (IRS) for the quality control of CChC batches and liquid media containing CChC which is used to preserve C. novyi 198 as spores.Materials and methods: thermally denatured CChC which was chemically synthesized from industrial CChC was used as candidate material. The quality control was performed using the test procedures described in procedural guidelines MUK 4.2.2316-08. C. novyi 198 spores were obtained as described in the \u00abSterility testing\u00bb section of MUK 4.2.2316-08 (preparation, inoculation and incubation in the medium containing calcium chloride casein IRS).Results: a list of quality parameters was developed for calcium chloride casein IRS: \u00abSpore formation\u00bb (certifiable parameter), \u00abAppearance\u00bb, \u00abLoss on drying\u00bb, \u00abClarity of medium\u00bb. The first batch of the candidate calcium chloride casein IRS was certified. The value of the \u00abSpore formation\u00bb certifiable parameter was found to be (32.6 \u00b1 7.3) %, the IRS shelf life was 5 years when stored in a dry place protected from light at a temperature of 15 to 25 \u00b0C. A documentation package for the IRS 4228-444-2018 was prepared and approved. The liquid medium containing CChC reference material (0.3 g/10 mL) allows for preservation of the biological properties of the C. novyi 198 working culture for at least 12 months.Conclusions: the certification results demonstrate that the calcium chloride casein IRS meets the applicable requirements and can be used as reference material to control the quality of new CChC batches and to assess the suitability of liquid medium containing CChC for preservation purposes.

monotherapy for MM. In this study, we found that subtoxic concentrations of PS-341 potently sensitized MM cell lines and patient cells to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin and melphalan, including cells resistant to these drugs and those isolated from a patient who had relapsed after PS-341 monotherapy. Moreover, PS-341 abolished cell adhesion\u2013mediated drug resistance. Using gene expression profiling and proteomic analysis, we demonstrate that PS-341, among its other proapoptotic effects, down-regulates the expression of several effectors involved in the cellular response to genotoxic stress. These data suggest that, in addition to down-regulating the expression of apoptosis inhibitors, PS-341 inhibits genotoxic stress response pathways and thereby restores sensitivity to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents. These studies, therefore, provide the framework for clinical use of this agent in combination with conventional chemotherapy.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"History\"]", "language": "en", "length": [16, 0, 0], "string": "title={REVIEWS OF BOOKS}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Complementary and Alternative Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [157, 0, 0], "string": "title={Carrer, L.

abstract={Purpose: To report the endovascular treatment of a symptomatic extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm that was complicated by heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. Methods and Results: After undergoing a coronary artery bypass graft procedure, a patient was diagnosed with a symptomatic, 3.5-cm ICA aneurysm by computed tomography and angiography. Via a semiclosed access, an Enduring vascular graft was inserted under controlled back bleeding from the ICA. The patient was recovering uneventfully when routine duplex scanning on the fifth postoperative day suggested multiple thrombi within the graft, which was confirmed by arteriography. Thrombectomy and local fibrinolysis were performed; however, the graft occluded the next day without causing neurological symptoms. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was diagnosed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Conclusions: Endovascular repair of high cervical extracranial ICA aneurysms is feasible, and protection against intracerebral embolization can be achieved using a semiclosed technique with controlled back bleeding from the ICA during endograft deployment. However, multiple thrombi or thrombotic occlusion during the postoperative period, particularly in a patient already sensitized to heparin, should direct attention toward possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Rheumatology\"]", "language": "de", "length": [138, 0, 0], "string": "title={Rheumatologie \u2013 aktuelle und zuk\u00fcnftige Versorgung von entz\u00fcndlichen und nichtentz\u00fcndlichen muskuloskelettalen Erkrankungen in Deutschland}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Nature and Landscape Conservation\", \"Ecology\", \"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics\", \"Forestry\"]", "language": "en", "length": [158, 0, 1546], "string": "title={A Review of the Concepts and Measurements for Connection to Nature and Environmentally Responsible Behaviour\u2014a Call for Research on Human-Forest Relationships}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Purpose of Review The review examines recent scientific discussion on the concepts and measurements of human connection to nature (CTN) and pro-environmental behaviour (PEB). In addition to that, we explore the environmental contexts in which study populations are exposed to nature or nature experiences, particularly the contexts in which forests emerge from these studies, and lastly outline gaps in research. Recent Findings Outlining the association between CTN and PEB has been widely researched over the past 5 years. The concepts and measurements referring to these terms vary, but a few commonly used concepts were identified. The review classifies the approaches used for exploring the relationship between CTN and PEB into four categories. The review indicates that the interconnection between CTN and PEB is mostly studied as a part of the wider concept. Approximately half of the reviewed articles explored the actual exposure to some natural environment or nature activity either directly or indirectly. Forests only played a small role as a natural environment in the reviewed articles. Summary Forests appear to be of very little weight or under-represented in CTN and PEB literature as an explicitly identified natural environment. Results also indicate that the human-forest relationship has not been defined precisely in empirically based scientific literature. The paper discusses implications for the future research focusing on emphasizing the role of forests as natural environments in the research of CTN and PEB.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0,

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the following topical solutions on the ciliary beat frequency (CBF) of nasal respiratory cells: ofloxacin as an antibiotic; Betadine and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as antiseptic; and amphotericin B, itraconazole, and clotrimazole as antifungal solutions. Differences are described between effects of each of these substances and we clarify whether ciliotoxic effects are dose dependent and if they can be reduced or eliminated by diluting the concentration of the applied solution. In a prospective study, nasal respiratory cells were harvested from healthy individuals and CBF was measured while cells were perfused with cell culture medium and the respective topical solution, using a Dvorak/Stotler exposure chamber. Controls were perfused with cell culture medium only. Video interference contrast microscopy was used to monitor CBF. A decrease of CBF occurred after application of all topical solutions used in this study. Except for clotrimazole, all solutions showed significantly stronger effects at high concentrations compared with diluted solutions. Our results indicate that topical application of antifungal, antibiotic, and antiseptic solutions may cause a marked impairment of mucociliary clearance. The strong dose dependence of these ciliotoxic effects indicates the need for a careful selection of the adequate concentration when using topical treatment in the nose.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0,

To investigate the mechanical properties and fracture behavior of rock with an intersecting hole under compressive loads, a series of uniaxial compression tests was carried out on cuboid red sandstone specimens containing an intersecting hole with three types of shapes by digital image correlation (DIC) technique. The results showed that the existing hole inside specimens leads to almost a 50% reduction of mechanical parameters from that of intact ones, and this weakening effect is associated with the shapes of holes. Failure of specimens is a progressive process in which cracks, i.e., primary tensile cracks, secondary tensile cracks, and shear cracks, initiate from stress concentration zones, propagate along certain direction, and coalesce with each other into macrofractures. Both the real-time principal strain fields and horizontal displacement fields of specimens under compression could be visually displayed by DIC system, and they were in good consistency in characterizing the fracture behavior.

warfarin management among health care professional in Qatar. A cross sectional survey}, container_title={}, abstract={AbstractIt is estimated that 10\u201315% of oral anticoagulant (OAC) patients, would need to hold their OAC for scheduled surgery. Especially for warfarin, this process is complex and requires multi-layer risk assessment and decisions across different specialties. Clinical guidelines deliver broad recommendations in the area of warfarin management before surgery which can lead to different trends and practices among practitioners. To evaluate the current attitude, awareness, and practice among health care providers (HCPs) on warfarin periprocedural management. A multiple-choice questionnaire was developed, containing questions on demographics and professional information and was completed by187 HCPs involved in warfarin periprocedural management. The awareness median (IQR) score was moderate [64.28% (21.43)]. The level of awareness was associated with the practitioner\u2019s specialty and degree of education (P = 0.009, 0.011 respectively). Practice leans to overestimate the need for warfarin discontinuation as well as the need for bridging.

Multivariate correspondence analysis (MCA) is a powerful method to solve the complex problem of the relationship between classified variables. Also known as corresponding analysis, it is a multivariate statistical analysis method that aims to describe the relationship between two classification variables in a corresponding table in a low-dimensional space. MCA has unique advantages when dealing with categorical variable data. It combines the advantages of factor analysis and multidimensional scaling. On the basis of combining and analysing the existing literature, this paper makes an analysis of the data obtained from a housing questionnaire survey collected in Jinan, Shandong Province, in 2017.

Discontinuity in the form of variation of the cross-sectional area (impedance mismatch) is induced in the longitudinal direction of the experimental specimen by butt welding two steel rods, as described in the previous work. The proposed methodology outlined for a sagged prismatic rod can be adopted for damage detection in a transmission line conductor made of wire rope. The corresponding wave reflections from the damage and boundaries are highlighted. Experiments are conducted on a predominantly single frequency based amplitude modulated narrow-banded, burst wave propagation. The novelty of the work is the experimental demonstration of narrow-banded single frequency wave generation with PZT patches with facility for a variable frequency excitation and controlled by a function generator. This is different from the conventional resonating piezo-crystal at ultrasonic frequency range, where the excitation is strong but the frequency is not variable. Also, the methodology is proposed for bifurcating the initial portion of the nondispersive wave propagation from a mixed-up response. For locating the bifurcation zone for axial\u2013flexural wave interaction, a moving correlation coefficient method is employed.

complementary nature of total productive maintenance (TPM) and reliability-centered maintenance (RCM). Design/methodology/approach This paper focuses on the operational aspect of the maintenance practice, proposing an equipment maintenance methodology that can be suitably adopted to define a new maintenance plan or check and improve an existing one. It integrates principles and methods of TPM and RCM and uses different tools to support decision-makers and operators. It proposes several worksheets which facilitate planning and implementing maintenance activities, that range from autonomous maintenance tasks to maintainability improvement actions. Findings This paper exploits the complementary nature of TPM and RCM to design or improve maintenance plans for a generic system. The tools and worksheets presented can be helpful to practitioners and operators. Originality/value While the integration of TPM and RCM is evidently a central issue in the maintenance management context, it has received limited attention in literature. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, it lacks a structured practical equipment maintenance methodology that exploits the complementary nature of TPM and RCM. Therefore, the approach presented in this paper would fill the current gap.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Gastroenterology\", \"Endocrine and Autonomic Systems\", \"Physiology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [73, 0, 0], "string": "title={Possible role of nitric oxide in postoperative ileus: a comparative study}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [129, 22, 2794], "string": "title={Is the minimal mitral regurgitation a marker of high blood pressure, and can predispose to the appearance of atrial fibrillation?}, container_title={European Heart Journal}, abstract={Abstract Background Leonardo da Vinci intuited that the cardiac valves were the key to the functioning of the heart. Minimal mitral regurgitation (MMR) in young's is often interpreted as haemodynamically insignificant, it is attributed that it starts from birth or named para-physiologic effect. Pathophysiological changes in the arterial wall can lead to mitral regurgitation, left atrial enlargement, and atrial fibrillation (AF). Purpose The aim of this study is to know if the presence of MMR is a consequence of the High Blood Pressure (BP), and whether in the own evolution can contribute to the appearance of the AF. Methods For this cross-sectional retrospective study, data were collected from 436 patients. Female-Male: 249\u2013187 from the 20 to the 89 years old, mean age (\u00b1SD) 59.6 (16.5) \u2013 59.7 (16.1), divided and analyzed in each one of them all 7 decades. All patients had MMR. Some patients were unaware of having hypertension, others with and without antihypertensive therapy. The measures of BP were registered in mmHg. The finding of AF was confirmed with the presence of brief phases in the 24hs-Holter monitoring. The Central Haemodynamic Parameters (CHP) were measured with a SphygmoCor System PVX (AtCor-Medical Australia), a validated device employing the high-fidelity technique of applanation tonometry according to established protocols. Also, the difference of Augmentation Index (between the normal levels and the observed values) was assessed according to the normal range by age. Results In all patients female - male, the mean (\u00b1SD) of SBP/DBP 142.7 (24.5)/83.7 (13.6) \u2013 137.7 (20.2)/82.4 (11.3) was higher than normal levels of BP accepted by ESC/ESH. All measures of CHP and SBP/DBP increased with age in each decade, in female from the 20s 120.3 (18.9)/76.7 (14.1) to the 80s 160.4 (21.1)/86.0 (25), and in male from the 20s 133.7 (16.7)/78.9 (6.4) to the 70s 142.8 (23.5)/78.8 (12.4), but slightly decreased in the 80s 138.4 (20.4)/76.6 (8.0). The difference of Augmentation index (surrogate value of arterial stiffness) in all decades was higher too, for both genders. In the adult total sample, in female - male the AF reached 26.5% - 27.8%, beginning after 33 years old, and strongly increased its prevalence after the 60s to a top of 50.0% - 43.8% at 80s. Conclusions MMR can be an early marker of high BP levels, the prevalence increasing with age, and it would be a predisposing condition to evolving to AF. The appearance of MMR principally among younger can indicate that the brachial BP found is higher than \u201cnormal\u201d, needing any time to modify the original ventricular geometry toward myocardial remodelling, Therefore, it should be reassessed the optimal levels of BP to avoid its complication.

Keeping Patients Engaged Through Group Activities}, container_title={}, abstract={Introduction: Weight management programs must be effective at engaging patients in order to be successful. However, few studies have examined program characteristics associated with better patient engagement. Hypothesis: The objective of this study was to assess patient engagement on a facility-level in the nation\u2019s largest population-based weight management program (MOVE!). Methods: Facility-level data were collected from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Support Services Center. Patient engagement was measured as the average number of MOVE! visits per patient per year (VPY). Bivariate statistics were examined and multivariate-adjusted generalized linear models were used to examine factors associated with VPY. Results: We identified 140 VHA hospitals enrolled in MOVE! between 2008-2013 representing a nationwide sample of 462,132 patients with over 3 million visits. The 140 hospitals were distributed across the nation and represented a population that was 15% female, 72% white, and 34% rural. In 2008, 96% of MOVE! programs offered group counseling, 53% offered weight loss medications, and 26% offered bariatric surgery. The average facility VPY was 5.3 (SD 2.9) and increased from 4.9 (SD 3.9) in 2008 to 6.3 (SD 2.8) in 2013 (p Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that weight loss programs offering group counseling may be more effective at engaging patients in the intervention. These findings identify potential areas for improving utilization of weight management programs.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Religious Studies\"]", "language": "de", "length": [203, 0, 0], "string": "title={Zander, Helmut: \u201aEurop\u00e4ische\u2018 Religionsgeschichte.
