However, the increasingly complexity and associated costs might threat their effective uptake in clinical practice. We aimed to study the pill burden and out-of-pocket costs of cardiovascular drug therapy of a contemporary cohort of HFrEF patients. Methods We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional, single-center study on a convenience sample of 100 consecutive HFrEF patients assessed at our HF outpatient clinic (January-June 2020). The pill burden was assessed by the number of prescribed different cardiovascular drugs and pills per day. The out-of-pocket (OOP) costs were defined using the total patients co-payment of cardiovascular medications per month of treatment, taken in account the exemptions provided by the Portuguese National Health System (NHS). The included drug classes were antiplatelets, anticoagulants, statins, HF drugs (Beta-blockers [BB], angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEi]/ angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]/ angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibition [ARNI], mineralocorticoid antagonists [MRA], sodium glucose cotransport inhibitors [iSGLT2], digoxin, loop diuretic) and antiarrhythmics. Results The mean age was 62\u00b112 years and only 24% were female. The etiology of HF was ischemic in 42% of the patients, 86% were in NYHA II class and 5% in NYHA III-IV. The mean LVEF was 34\u00b15% and the median NT-proBNP was 482 pg/mL [172\u20131120]. 92% of patients were on BB, 67% on ACEI/ARBs, 25% on ARNI, 81% on MRA and 30% on iSGLT2. The use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators was 38% and 20% of patients were resynchronized. The number of cardiovascular (CV) drugs per day was 5.4\u00b11.6 per patient and the number of CV pills per day was 6.6\u00b12. Most patients (65%) had low income and had the maximal exemption on medication costs provided by NHS. Overall, the mean OOP costs was \u20ac16.1 per month of treatment and the mean OOP costs for patients exempted and not exempted was \u20ac12.9 and \u20ac22.3, respectively. The mean OOP costs of evidence-based HF-modifying drugs (BB, ACEI/ARBs, ARNI, MRA, iSGLT2) was \u20ac10.1 and the mean OOP costs of evidence-based HF-modifying drugs for patients exempted and not exempted were \u20ac7.9 and \u20ac14.2, respectively. However, for patients on ARNI the mean OOP costs was almost 3 times higher (\u20ac33.6). Conclusions In this optimally treated contemporary cohort of HFrEF, the pill burden due to cardiovascular therapy only is high (7 pills/day). With the exception of patients on ARNI, the overall OOP costs of HF-modifying prognostic drugs are low.

Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) hydrolyzes EETs to less biologically active metabolites. The variant Gln287 of EPHX2 encodes for a sEH enzyme with reduced hydrolase activity. In murine models of type 2 diabetes, inhibition of sEH or EPHX2 deletion results in improved insulin sensitivity. In humans, forearm blood flow is significantly increased in Gln287 variant allele carriers. Given that insulin sensitivity is influenced by vascular perfusion, we hypothesized that insulin sensitivity would be increased in Gln287-carriers compared with wild-type individuals. Insulin secretion and sensitivity were assessed in 63 volunteers (43 with metabolic syndrome, 34 females, 42.5 \u00b1 13 years old, 15 black Americans) during hyperglycemic clamps. Statistical analyses were adjusted for BMI. Plasma total- (r=0.63, p=0.007), 14-15- (r=0.62, p=0.008), and 11-12- (r=0.57, p=0.02) EET concentrations correlated with insulin sensitivity. There was no effect of genotype on insulin secretion (not shown). In individuals without metabolic syndrome, insulin sensitivity was significantly increased in Gln287 variant carriers compared with wild-type individuals (Fig. A). Insulin sensitivity was decreased in individuals with the metabolic syndrome, but also trended higher in Gln287 variant carriers when compared with wild-type individuals (Fig. B).

OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to evaluate the antihyperglycaemic activity of ethanol fruit extract of Borassus aethiopum in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. METHODS: 36 rats were placed in six groups (i-vi) (n = 6). Animals in group i (standard) were given 0.4 mls of distilled water (d.w) whereas the ones assigned to group ii, iii, iv, v and vi which were induced into diabetes (by intake of 140 mg/kg body weight [b.w] of alloxan) were also respectively given d.w, 50 mg/kg b.w of metformin, 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg b.w of ethanol fruit extract of Borassus aethiopum, once daily for 14 days. RESULTS: Flavonoid found in the extract (24.04 mg/ml) occurred the most with phenolic (0.35 mg/ml) being the least. While alloxan substantially (p 0.05) well with those of the d.w treated non-diabetic animals and metformin-treated diabetic animals.

The latter also include its participation in the development and progression of malignant neoplasms, which are often accompanied by increased protein synthesis. In addition to the elucidation of the molecular functions of TGase 2 in tumor cells, knowledge of its concentration that is available for targeting by theranostic agents is a valuable information. Herein, we describe the application of a recently developed fluorescence anisotropy (FA)-based assay for the quantitative expression profiling of TGase 2 by means of transamidase-active enzyme in cell lysates. This assay is based on the incorporation of rhodamine B-isonipecotyl-cadaverine (R-I-Cad) into N,N-dimethylated casein (DMC), which results in an increase in the FA signal over time. It was shown that this reaction is not only catalyzed by TGase 2 but also by TGases 1, 3, and 6 and factor XIIIa using recombinant proteins. Therefore, control measurements in the presence of a selective irreversible TGase 2 inhibitor were mandatory to ascertain the specific contribution of TGase 2 to the overall FA rate. To validate the assay regarding the quality of quantification, spike/recovery and linearity of dilution experiments were performed. A total of 25 cancer and 5 noncancer cell lines were characterized with this assay method in terms of their activatable TGase 2 concentration (fmol/\u00b5g protein lysate) and the results were compared to protein synthesis data obtained by Western blotting. Moreover, complementary protein quantification methods using a biotinylated irreversible TGase 2 inhibitor as an activity-based probe and a commercially available ELISA were applied to selected cell lines to further validate the results obtained by the FA-based assay. Overall, the present study demonstrates that the FA-based assay using the substrate pair R-I-Cad and DMC represents a facile, homogenous and continuous method for quantifying TGase 2 activity in cell lysates.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0,

The sampling method used is probability sampling techniques with simple random sampling. The data was collected using an electronic questionnaire to 120 respondents and data analysis using smart pls 3.3.3 software. The results showed that work-life balance has a positive but insignificant relationship with performance. In contrast, the work-life balance variable has a positive and significant relationship with positive emotions, and positive emotions are positively and significantly related to employee performance.

Eight six-month-old male New Zealand rabbits were randomly distributed into three treatments: D (2.5 \u03bcg/kg); DL (2.5 \u03bcg/kg; 2 mg/kg); and L (2 mg/kg). The drugs were injected epidurally via a catheter. Cardiorespiratory, arterial blood gas and antinociceptive variables were recorded before administration, 5 and 10 min after drug administration, then every 10 min until the animals presented a positive response to nociceptive stimulation of perineal dermatomes. Two animals had permanent paralysis after DL treatment due to hemorrhage and congestion with neuron necrosis in spinal cord segments. There was a reduction in mean arterial pressure in treatment L at 5 and 10 min, compared with the baseline, and in treatment DL at 10\u201330 min. Increases in pH were observed in treatment D at 5 and 10 min, and in DL at all the times evaluated, compared with the baseline. No alterations were observed in other blood gas or electrolyte variables. Antinociceptive effects were evaluated in the perineal, sacral and lumbar regions, and were restricted to the perineal region following D and L treatment. The antinociceptive effects following DL were greater than D and L alone in all of the regions.

They encode accessory factors for the ATP-binding cassette transporters that mediate secretion of the antimicrobial peptides. Here, we show that gdmH also contributes to immunity to gallidermin but not to nisin. gdmH alone affected susceptibility to gallidermin only moderately, but it led to a multiplication of the immunity level mediated by the FEG immunity genes when cloned together with the gdmT gene, suggesting a synergistic activity of the H and FEG systems. gdmH -related genes were identified in the genomes of several bacteria, indicating an involvement in further cellular functions.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Pharmacology (medical)\", \"Pharmacology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [70, 0, 0], "string": "title={Prolonged Sitting and the Risk of Cardiovascular Disease and Mortality}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Behavioral Neuroscience\", \"Applied Psychology\", \"Human Factors and Ergonomics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [45, 0, 935], "string": "title={Posture, Postural Discomfort, and Performance}, container_title={}, abstract={In order to justify the costs of using ergonomically designed workplaces, it is necessary to relate improved posture to improved performance.

Both postural condition and time on task affected measures of posture, measures of postural discomfort, and performance. Poor defect detection performance was associated with increased forward inclination of the trunk, increased perceived discomfort, and increased frequency of posture changes. Subjects tried to maintain their defect detection performance over time by spending longer on each board, but they were only partially successful. In addition to providing positive evidence to justify the cost of ergonomic changes in posture, the results provide a simple and consistent set of measures to be used in future work.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Surfaces, Coatings and Films\", \"Physical and Theoretical Chemistry\", \"Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials\"]", "language": "en", "length": [76, 35, 0], "string": "title={Origin of the Thickness-Dependent Oxidation of Ultrathin Cu Films on Au(111)}, container_title={The Journal of Physical Chemistry C}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Molecular Biology\", \"Biochemistry\", \"Biophysics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [100, 0, 0], "string": "title={Electron spin resonance studies on the conformation and interactions of histones containing cysteine}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Psychiatry and Mental Health\", \"Neurology (clinical)\"]", "language": "de", "length": [76, 0, 0], "string": "title={Book review: Die Welt der Psychotherapie.

Since these POEs face high opportunity costs for own branding, given their dominant presence in the global subcontracting community, their own branding actions require contextual understanding of doing business in China. This study starts with the notion of how these POEs shift from subcontracting to own branding, and explores their respective own branding paths. We interviewed seven Chinese POEs in the fashion industry in Zhejiang Province: Babei, Baili, Sunrise, Aokang, Youngor, Kangnai, and JNBY. The case studies suggest how these firms built their brands in the global market, and why their trajectories differentiated in the course of own branding. Our study configures three types of own brand models for POEs: the competitive subcontracting, the toehold, and the home-linked organic models. POEs can continue subcontracting in their core business, while implementing own branding through diversification. Alternatively, they can segregate markets, pursuing own branding in one group of countries, while subcontracting elsewhere. In addition, they may establish wholly owned enterprises, and introduce their brands in a way that preserves their home market advantages. We identify two stimuli for Chinese POEs\u2019 global branding choices. Global branding strengthens domestic position as it becomes a signal for reputation. As the online platform reduces costs for global branding, and becomes popular, POEs are more likely to pursue global branding to become more competitive in the domestic market.

We address this shortcoming by presenting a detection algorithm for the flow-based detection of compromises, i.e., hosts that have been compromised during an attack. Our algorithm has been implemented as part of our open-source IDS SSHCure and validated using almost 100 servers, workstations and honeypots, featuring an accuracy close to 100%.}",

Other research, based on foreign firms, argues that greater managerial ownership leads to entrenchment, and the negative relation with analyst following reflects analyst reluctance to follow firms with incentives to withhold information (Lang, Lins, and Miller [2004]). We further evaluate these two explanations by directly examining the link between ownership structure and a firm's disclosure environment. Using a sample of 25,855 U.S. firm-year observations from 1995 to 2006, we confirm a negative relation between managerial ownership and analyst coverage. We also find that managerial ownership is negatively related to the likelihood of management issuing earnings forecasts and find that this negative relation is most pronounced for firms with impending \u201cbad news.\u201d Furthermore, firms with higher managerial ownership release less accurate and more optimistic forecasts, particularly when faced with bad news. Overall, our results support the view that agency problems associated with greater managerial ownership contribute to less disclosure and a more opaque information environment, which discourage analyst following. We examine these two explanations from an investor perspective and find that the joint effect of greater managerial ownership and greater analyst coverage enhance firm value. This result is again inconsistent with the notion that greater managerial ownership reduces the need for analyst monitoring.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Zun\u00e4chst wird die Entwicklung des niederen Schulwesens und der Anstieg der Literalit\u00e4t im 16. und 17.||Jahrhundert in den Blick genommen.

Patients With Ibrutinib-Associated Cardiotoxicity}, container_title={}, abstract={ImportanceIbrutinib has been associated with serious cardiotoxic arrhythmias. In preclinical models, these events are paralleled or proceeded by diffuse myocardial injury (inflammation and fibrosis). Yet whether this is seen in patients or has implications for future cardiotoxic risk is unknown.ObjectiveTo assess the incidence and outcomes of myocardial injury among patients with ibrutinib-related cardiotoxicity.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis cohort study included consecutive patients treated with ibrutinib from 2012 to 2019, phenotyped using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) from a large US Comprehensive Cancer Center registry.ExposuresIbrutinib treatment for cancer control.Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was the presence of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) fibrosis. The secondary outcome was the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as atrial fibrillation, heart failure, symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden death of probable or definite ibrutinib association after CMR. We also assessed parametric-mapping subclinical fibrosis (native-T1, extracellular volume fraction) and inflammation/edema (max-T2) measures. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance measures were compared with those obtained in similar consecutive patients with cancer without ibrutinib treatment (pretreatment controls). Observed measures were also compared with similar-aged broad population rates (general-population controls) and a broader pool of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk\u2013matched cancer controls. Multivariable regression was used to assess the association between CMR measures and MACE.ResultsOverall, 49 patients treated with ibrutinib were identified, including 33 imaged after treatment initiation (mean [SD] age, 65 [10] years, 9 [27%] with hypertension, and 23 [69.7%] with index-arrhythmias); median duration of ibrutinib-use was 14 months. The mean (SD) pretreatment native T1 was 977.0 (73.0) ms, max-T2 56.5 (4.0) ms, and 4 (13.3%) had LGE. Posttreatment initiation, mean (SD) native T1 was 1033.7 (48.2) ms, max-T2 61.5 (4.8) ms, and 17 (54.8%) had LGE (P &amp;lt; .001, P = .01, and P &amp;lt; .001, respectively, pre- vs post-ibrutinib treatment). Native T12SDs was elevated in 9 (28.6%), and max-T22SDs in 21 (63.0%), respectively. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance measures were highest in those with suspected toxic effects (P = .01 and P = .01, respectively). There was no association between traditional CVD-risk or cancer-treatment status and abnormal CMR measures. Among those without traditional CVD, 16 (58.6%) had LGE vs 38 (13.3%) in matched-controls (relative-risk, 4.8; P &amp;lt; .001). Over a median follow-up of 19 months, 13 (39.4%) experienced MACE.

We aimed to estimate potential injury reductions for 4 population-level interventions that target restraint practices for child car passengers aged 0 to 12 years. METHODS: Population-attributable risk fraction (PARF) is a population-level estimate of excess risk from exposure to a risk factor. PARFs were calculated for each intervention scenario by using published age-specific mortality/injury relative-risk estimates; restraint practices among injured child car passengers from police-collected data; and observational data for correctness of restraint use in New South Wales, Australia. PARF reductions were estimated for population uptakes of 25%, 50%, and 75%. RESULTS: Assuming a 50% population uptake, (1) promoting age-appropriate restraint use could prevent additional fatalities (5.1%, infants; 3.4%, 1- to 6-year-olds) and nonfatal injuries (3.2%, infants; 16.2%, 1- to 6-year-olds) compared with promoting any restraint use; (2) further encouraging correct age-appropriate restraint use could also prevent additional fatalities (9.1%, infants; 14.3%, 1- to 6-year-olds) and nonfatal injuries (9.2%, infants; 10.7%, 1- to 6-year-olds); and (3) for children aged 7 to 12 years, promoting correct use of restraints could prevent an additional 3.4% fatalities and 3.1% nonfatal injuries compared with promoting any restraint use. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that target child passenger-restraint practices offer population-level benefits in terms of reduction in fatalities and injuries. These tangible benefits call for action internationally, not only to promote restraint use but correct age-appropriate restraint use for child car passengers.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering\", \"Polymers and Plastics\", \"History\", \"Business and International Management\"]", "language": "en", "length": [150, 0, 0], "string": "title={Direct Z-Scheme Co3o4 Quantum Dots/Bi2moo6 Heterostructure for Rapid Tetracycline Degradation: Performance, Degradation Pathways and Mechanism Insight}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cell Biology\", \"Molecular Biology\", \"Biochemistry\"]", "language": "en", "length": [103, 19, 1215], "string": "title={The synthesis of inhibitors for processing proteinases and their action on the Kex2 proteinase of yeast}, container_title={Biochemical Journal}, abstract={Peptidyl chloromethane and sulphonium salts containing multiple Arg and Lys residues were synthesized as potential inhibitors of prohormone and pro-protein processing proteinases.

abstract={An online group work project for off campus students, using wikis as the collaboration platform, has been conducted successfully for several years. Students were given the opportunity and technical means to collaborate, and staff could assess individual students' participation. However, the actual level of collaboration was less than hoped for, especially in early iterations of the unit. While the teaching staff are confident that, for the overall student cohort, collaborating online using a wiki is meeting the needs of most students, this is varied across the diverse cohort. To gain further insight into the internal machinations of student groups, selected students were invited to submit their experiences of their wiki project. This paper reports the personal stories of two off campus students, and compares the experiences described by our students with the teaching staff members' perceptions. The two students featured were selected not just for their articulate writing, but because their group experiences were quite different. Considering these students' experiences has allowed the teaching staff to reflect on how to better support our students during their group project.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

However, with an abundance of tumor sequencing data and trial eligibility criteria available, it can be challenging for clinicians to identify PM trial options for patients. To address this challenge at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), we developed MatchMiner, an open-source platform for computationally matching patients to PM trials. MatchMiner has three modes of use: (1) patient-centric, where clinicians can view all available trial matches for a patient, (2) trial-centric, where clinical trial teams identify patients for their trials based on genomic and clinical criteria, and (3) trial search, where clinicians search for available trials based on clinical and genomic eligibility. Trial matching is performed via the MatchEngine, which computes trial matches based on patient genomic and clinical data and PM trial eligibility criteria. To encode trial eligibility criteria, we developed a structured format called clinical trial markup language (CTML), which uses Boolean logic to encode inclusion and exclusion criteria. Here, we describe our implementation of MatchMiner at DFCI including strategies that were successful and MatchMiner\u2019s impact on trial consent. Since MatchMiner first went live in March 2017, a number of strategies have helped facilitate utilization of MatchMiner. The biggest impact has come from targeted departmental collaborations (Gastrointestinal, Breast, and Center for Cancer Therapeutic Innovation or CCTI), where the MatchMiner team worked directly with key departmental stakeholders to develop customized workflows. To facilitate access to MatchMiner among individual clinicians, we integrated the patient-centric and trial search modes into the Epic electronic health record. Other implementation strategies were piloted, such as weekly emails to clinicians alerting them to potential trial matches, but were less impactful. Overall, departmental collaborations have resulted in several ongoing MatchMiner initiatives. Thus far at DFCI, we have curated 354 PM trials into MatchMiner and facilitated 220 patient consents. For PM trials, 222 genes, 7 mutational signatures and nearly all cancer types were represented, demonstrating that there is a wide range of PM trial options available to patients. We also examined the distribution of trial phases and disease centers running each trial. The majority were Phase I and Phase II trials run out of the CCTI, consistent with the frequency with which novel drugs do not progress to later phase trials. Lastly, we have identified 220 trial consents that benefitted from MatchMiner. Retrospective analysis of a subset of these trial consents (n=166) revealed a significant 22% decrease in time to consent relative to other consents to the same trials, demonstrating the clinical impact of MatchMiner.

astronomy. In this work, we present a new approach to solving this problem: a Vienna inverse-Abel-transform based object reconstruction algorithm AVIATOR. The reconstruction that it performs is based on the assumption that the distribution along the line of sight is similar to the distribution in the plane of projection, which requires a morphological analysis of the structures in the projected image. The output of the AVIATOR algorithm is an estimate of the 3D distribution in the form of a reconstruction volume that is calculated without the problematic requirements that commonly occur in other reconstruction methods such as symmetry in the plane of projection or modelling of radial profiles. We demonstrate the robustness of the technique to different geometries, density profiles, and noise by applying the AVIATOR algorithm to several model objects. In addition, the algorithm is applied to real data: We reconstruct the density and temperature distributions of two dense molecular cloud cores and find that they are in excellent agreement with profiles reported in the literature. The AVIATOR algorithm is thus capable of reconstructing 3D distributions of physical quantities consistently using an intuitive set of assumptions.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Yet, equivalence in construct measurement across groups cannot be assumed. To address this issue, we examined data from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging, a large study of older adults. We tested the hypothesis that the latent variables underlying the neuropsychological battery administered in French or English were the same (invariant). The best-fitting baseline model, established in the English-speaking Exploratory sample (n = 716), replicated well in the English-speaking Validation sample (n = 715), and the French-speaking sample (FS, n = 446). Across the English- and FSs, two of the factors, Long-term Retrieval and Visuospatial speed, displayed invariance, that is, reflected the same constructs measured in the same scales. In contrast, the Verbal Ability factor showed only partial invariance, reflecting differences in the relative difficulty of some tests of language functions.

KRAS p.G12C mutation: A phase I/II study evaluating efficacy and safety}, container_title={}, abstract={360490 Background: KRAS mutation is present in 90% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas with p.G12C accounting for 1% to 2% of these mutations. Sotorasib, a small molecule that specifically and irreversibly inhibits KRASG12C, has been investigated in the CodeBreaK100 trial in patients with KRASG12C-mutated advanced solid tumors. Herein, we report on the largest dataset evaluating efficacy and safety of a KRASG12C inhibitor in patients with pretreated KRASG12C-mutated pancreatic cancer. Methods: CodeBreaK100 (NCT03600883) is an international, single arm, phase I/II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of sotorasib in patients with KRASG12C-mutated advanced solid tumors with \u2265 1 prior systemic therapy unless intolerant or ineligible for available therapies. The primary efficacy endpoint is confirmed objective response rate (ORR), assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) per RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints include duration of response (DoR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Results: As of November 1, 2021, 38 patients with pancreatic cancer (mean age: 65 years, 76.3% male) from the combined phase I/II study received sotorasib 960 mg once daily. Stage IV disease was present in 55.3% of patients at diagnosis, and in all patients at enrollment. Baseline ECOG scores were 0, 1, or 2 in 31.6%, 57.9%, and 10.5% of patients, respectively. Most patients (79%) had \u2265 2 prior lines of therapy (median: 2 [range: 1-8]). Median treatment duration was 4.1 months with a median follow-up of 16.8 months. Eight patients had confirmed partial response by BICR with a resulting ORR of 21.1% (95% CI: 9.55%-37.32%). DCR was 84.2% (Table 1). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade occurred in 16 (42.1%) patients. Grade \u2265 3 TRAEs occurred in 6 patients: diarrhea (2); fatigue (2); abdominal pain, ALT increase, AST increase, pleural effusion, and pulmonary embolism (1 each). No TRAEs were fatal or resulted in sotorasib discontinuation. Conclusions: Sotorasib demonstrated clinically meaningful anticancer activity and tolerability in patients with heavily pretreated KRASG12C-mutated advanced pancreatic cancer, who have limited treatment options and poor prognosis.

hippocampal high-frequency oscillations, or ripples. Post-learning increase in ripple rate is predictive of memory recall, while ripple disruption impairs learning. Ripples may thus present a fundamental component of a neurophysiological mechanism of memory consolidation. In addition to system-level local and cross-regional interactions, a consolidation mechanism involves stabilization of memory representations at the synaptic level. Synaptic plasticity within experience-activated neuronal networks is facilitated by noradrenaline release from the axon terminals of the locus coeruleus (LC). Here, to better understand interactions between the system and synaptic mechanisms underlying \u201coff-line\u201d consolidation, we examined the effects of ripple-associated LC activation on hippocampal and cortical activity and on spatial memory. Rats were trained on a radial maze; after each daily learning session neural activity was monitored for 1 h via implanted electrode arrays. Immediately following \u201con-line\u201d detection of ripple, a brief train of electrical pulses (0.05 mA) was applied to LC. Low-frequency (20 Hz) stimulation had no effect on spatial learning, while higher-frequency (100 Hz) trains transiently blocked generation of ripple-associated cortical spindles and caused a reference memory deficit. Suppression of synchronous ripple/spindle events appears to interfere with hippocampal-cortical communication, thereby reducing the efficiency of \u201coff-line\u201d memory consolidation.}",

However, there is limited information about the knowledge and attitudes of social researchers for research ethics in Vietnam. This paper aims to assess the knowledge and attitudes of social researchers about research ethics in Vietnam. A survey with 1200 questionnaires, through convenience sampling, was sent either printed copies or email to social researchers in the universities and research institutions in Vietnam. Our response rate was 65% (782), with mean age: 35.9 years (sd=.307). The results show that around one fifth had been trained with research ethics (23.5%), which led to significant responses to the \"do not know\" about the research ethics principles and research ethics committee with 14.3% and 55.3%, respectively. Despite such few experiences on the research ethics, the participants presented a positive understanding of the general principles of research ethics and positive attitudes to the importance of the related general ethics principles to social research in Vietnam. Such understandings and attitudes also led to the readiness to apply the research ethics values and principles while there are no formal ethical guidelines in Vietnam social research. These findings suggest that Vietnamese social researchers understood most critical ethics principles in social research and expect formal ethical guidelines.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

abstract={Background: Visual illusions (VI) in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) are generally considered as an early feature of the psychosis spectrum leading to fully formed visual hallucinations (VH), although this sequential relationship has not been clearly demonstrated. Objective: We aimed to determine whether there are any overlapping, potentially graded patterns of structural and functional connectivity abnormalities in PD with VI and with VH. Such a finding would argue for a continuum between these entities, whereas distinct imaging features would suggest different neural underpinnings for the phenomena. Methods: In this case control study, we compared structural and resting state functional MRI brain patterns of PD patients with VH (PD-H, n = 20), with VI (PD-I, n = 19), and without VH or VI (PD-C, n = 23). Results: 1) PD-H had hypo-connectivity between the ILO and anterior cingulate precuneus and parahippocampal gyrus compared to PD-C and PD-I; 2) In contrast, PD-I had hyper-connectivity between the inferior frontal gyrus and the postcentral gyrus compared to PD-C and PD-H. Moreover, PD-I had higher levels of functional connectivity between the amygdala, hippocampus, insula, and fronto-temporal regions compared to PD-H, together with divergent patterns toward the cingulate. 3) Both PD-I and PD-H had functional hypo-connectivity between the lingual gyrus and the parahippocampal region vs. PD-C, and no significant grey matter volume differences was observed between PD-I and PD-H. Conclusion: Distinct patterns of functional connectivity characterized VI and VH in PD, suggesting that these two perceptual experiences, while probably linked and driven by at least some similar mechanisms, could reflect differing neural dysfunction.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Sociology and Political Science\"]", "language": "en", "length": [168, 11, 0], "string": "title={Skills for Direct Practice in Social Work Ruth R.

Thematic analysis was used to identify eight themes related to challenges: (i) social isolation and loneliness, (ii) self-esteem and self-efficacy, (iii) declining mobility, health and activity levels, (iv) high medical expenses, (v) age discrimination and long wait times for medical health services, (vi) age discrimination, retirement, and wanting part-time employment, (vii) not enough gender-specific social participation activities, and (viii) housing insecurity. Four themes related to strengths were identified: (i) An \u201cI have enough\u201d mindset, (ii) strong formal social support, (iii) contributing to the community and others, and (v) \u201cMost of us like to be alone.\u201d Successfully addressing poverty in old age and tackling the challenges associated with living alone will require focusing on and activating not only external and systemic resources but also the intrinsic capacities and strengths of older adults themselves. Five discussion points are raised addressing the implications for future gerontological research and practice.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Psychiatry and Mental Health\"]", "language": "en", "length": [91, 0, 1806], "string": "title={The suicidality continuum in a large sample of obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD) patients}, container_title={}, abstract={AbstractBackgroundObsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD) has a chronic course leading to huge impact in the patient\u2019s functioning. Suicidal thoughts and attempts are much more frequent in OCD subjects than once thought before.AimTo empirically investigate whether the suicidal phenomena could be analyzed as a suicidality severity continuum and its association with obsessive\u2013compulsive (OC) symptom dimensions and quality of life (QoL), in a large OCD sample.MethodsCross-sectional study with 548 patients diagnosed with OCD according to the DSM-IV criteria, interviewed in the Brazilian OCD Consortium (C-TOC) sites. Patients were evaluated by OCD experts using standardized instruments including: Yale-Brown Obsessive\u2013Compulsive Scale (YBOCS); Dimensional Yale-Brown Obsessive\u2013Compulsive Scale (DYBOCS); Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories; Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID); and the SF-36 QoL Health Survey.ResultsThere were extremely high correlations between all the suicidal phenomena. OCD patients with suicidality had significantly lower QoL, higher severity in the \u201csexual/religious\u201d, \u201caggression\u201d and \u201csymmetry/ordering\u201d OC symptom dimensions, higher BDI and BA scores and a higher frequency of suicide attempts in a family member. In the regression analysis, the factors that most impacted suicidality were the sexual dimension severity, the SF-36 QoL Mental Health domain, the severity of depressive symptoms and a relative with an attempted suicide history.ConclusionsSuicidality could be analyzed as a severity continuum and patients should be carefully monitored since they present with suicidal ideation. Lower QoL scores, higher scores on the sexual dimension and a family history of suicide attempts should be considered as risk factors for suicidality among OCD patients.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0,

familiar line of his Bellum Civile, at a time when C. Scribonius Curio the younger had been a hundred years in his grave. Lucan was not the first to describe Curio as audax; Velleius Paterculus did so before him: \u2018bello autem civili \u2026 non alius maiorem flagrantioremque quam C. Curio tribunus plebis subiecit facem, vir nobilis, eloquens, audax,\u2019, 11, 48, 3. It seems, indeed, that the attribute audax was traditional for Curio and, if this is so, the tradition may well have originated in Curio's own time. His title to a place in Roman history rested on the fact that he changed sides at a critical juncture\u2014\u2018momentumque fuit mutatus Curio rerum\u2019 (Lucan IV, 819). And what earned him, whether in his lifetime or posthumously, the derogatory attribute audax was, I think, his political career, notably the record of his tribuneship, no less, if not more, than his character. Audax, as originally applied to Curio, was very probably a conventional partisan appellation which classified him more effectively as a political type than it characterized him as an individual. For the derogatory audax, as I shall presently try to show, belongs in the late Republican period to the current phraseology of political backbiting and it carries a distinctly political connotation. It is the purpose of this paper to consider what audax denotes in the vocabulary of Roman political life in the late Republic as well as who are regarded as audaces in Roman politics.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Computer Networks and Communications\", \"Human-Computer Interaction\"]", "language": "en", "length": [124, 12, 0], "string": "title={Open Networks, Closed Regimes: The Impact of the Internet on Authoritarian Rule (Chapter 2 Wired for Modernization in China)}, container_title={First Monday}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Biophysics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [94, 19, 0], "string": "title={Modelling the Inhibition of Amyloid-\u03b2 Aggregation causing Alzheimer's Disease using D-Peptides}, container_title={Biophysical Journal}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Clinical Biochemistry\"]", "language": "en", "length": [93, 0, 1848], "string": "title={Selection Approach for Indian Medical Residency Program: Perspective of Interns and Residents}, container_title={}, abstract={Introduction: Indian Postgraduate (PG) selection process has undergone various modifications since the past decade including the recent single nationalised entrance test initiated from April 2016. The perception of graduates and PGs for the type and process of selection test is not known. Aim: To study the perception of interns and residents regarding the process of the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test for Postgraduates (NEET-PG) selection test. Materials and Methods: An exploratory qualitative thematic analytic study was conducted using purposive sampling with Semi-Structured Interviews (SSI), as per gender and academic grading, interns, and residents were selected. Eleven interns and ten first year residents took part. Braun and Clarke's six-phase thematic analysis framework was used for data analysis. Results: Three themes emerged; \"building validity\", \"Proposed modifications\" and \"learning by the assessment\". Validity building was related in terms of framing the multiple-choice questions, the format of the examination, and single attempt made per year. Different modifications were suggested by graduates and residents, in terms of assessment tools and strategies. Significant variations were observed in terms of learning by present assessment. Conclusion: The NEET-PG, a single nationalised assessment, appears to be well accepted with questioning for its validity in terms of assessment tool used, leading to restricted learning for the applicants.

place. Findings show that crowdfunding projects are hybrid and include the elements of crowdsourcing, crowdsensing, crowdfunding, crowdworking, and crowdsourced recruitment. The predominant role of security guarantees was identified. It turned out that relations irreducible to a simple hierarchy pose many challenges. The results indicate that leading issues include the lack of financial guarantees and the likelihood of information leakage to competitors. Hence, the priority is to manage the exchange of money and information. An interesting finding demonstrates a positive correlation between project success, ethical conduct, and fair distribution of gains. The protection of intellectual property rights was no less important. As it was concluded in the course of analysis, the more successful the project, the more thoroughly it addresses the protection of someone else's intellectual property.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0,

from Herakleon City, Abu Kir Bay, Alexandria, Egypt. The nano structured silicone wax film resulted in the formation of a structure that can act as a barrier layer from corrosion. The application of NSW coatings on bronze artifacts was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy techniques. Exposure of bronze samples with and without the nano silicone wax coating to sodium chloride solution led to a remarkable inhibition of corrosion for the coated samples only. Comparison of the inhibition efficiency obtained from samples coated with nano silicone wax coatings to that obtained from silicone wax coatings in normal size revealed that the protection efficiency is very high in case of nano silicone wax coatings compared to the traditional silicone wax coatings. The application of nano silicone wax coatings on bronze artifacts can pave the way into the development of safe and tailored solutions in the field of ancient metal artifacts conservation.

Bulimia nervosa (BN) also has been associated with abnormal neuroendocrine regulation. Thus, we examined the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and plasma ghrelin concentrations in patients with BN for the first time. METHODS: The subjects included 15 female BN patients and 11 female healthy volunteers (controls). Fasting blood samples were collected from all subjects. RESULTS: The plasma ghrelin concentrations in all subjects demonstrated a significantly negative correlation with BMI. Mean plasma ghrelin level in BN patients was significantly higher than that in the controls, though mean BMIs between the groups were not significantly different. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that not only BMI but also abnormal eating behaviors with habitual binge eating and purging may have some influence on circulating ghrelin level in BN.}",

for a Higgs boson that is produced in association with a Z boson and that decays to an undetected particle together with an isolated photon. The search is performed by the CMS Collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider using a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb \u22121 recorded at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No significant excess of events above the expectation from the standard model background is found. The results are interpreted in the context of a theoretical model in which the undetected particle is a massless dark photon. An upper limit is set on the product of the cross section for associated Higgs and Z boson production and the branching fraction for such a Higgs boson decay, as a function of the Higgs boson mass. For a mass of 125 GeV, assuming the standard model production cross section, this corresponds to an observed (expected) upper limit on this branching fraction of 4.6 (3.6)% at 95% confidence level. These are the first limits on Higgs boson decays to final states that include an undetected massless dark photon.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

"title={Prediction of Nonlinear Production Performance in Waterflooding Project Using a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm}, container_title={}, abstract={The paper presents a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm applied to history matching of waterflooding projects, which is to search a feasible set of geological properties showing the reliable future performance. Typical history matching has concentrated on single objective function with linearly weighted terms, even as a realistic field includes many wells and well measurements in time and type. The optimal solution is sensitive to weight factor and competing match criteria of individual term in the objective function often reduce the likelihood of finding an acceptable match. The unacceptable error at a specified well can be observed in a heterogeneous reservoir where shows nonlinear well performances. To overcome the inaccuracy, a new history matching approach is developed that allows the performance characteristics of the whole wells. Individual well performance is optimized separately using genetic algorithm coupled with non-dominated sorting and diversity preservation. The fitness is sorted along to the proximity and then the diversity is added by examining the crowding distance as the approach to arrive at the global optimum. Waterflooding is demonstrated in a heterogeneous oil reservoir with multiple production wells. The predictability of unknown future production performance is compared with that of single objective function, the conventional history matching method. The model represents individualized well-performance more accurately than the conventional history matching. It improves a certainty of the conventional model by showing small error range. The selection of adequate set of reservoir properties is possible among the feasible solutions unlike the conventional model.

Current literature on Industry 4.0 maturity and assessment models underlies the importance of a proper development strategy with exact steps to perform. Design principles address the issue of systematizing the measurable and attainable steps for further development. The present study contributes towards the identification of the research gap in the presence of core Industry 4.0 design principles during the development of maturity models.

His work is found to be that of collecting, assembling and analytically treating large quantities of basic data to the end that physical and economic results are optimized. The need for methods to simplify and speed the data collecting and analytical processes of reservoir engineering is discussed. An organization utilized by one company to speed these processes is described. A general discussion of the use of analog computers and the result of six years' experience with this approach is given. It has been found that the reservoir engineer can quickly and easily adjust himself to the use of computers as a routine part of the solution to the over-all problem. In so doing, the burden of manual computation and data processing has been considerably lightened, thereby allowing him to devote more time to original and creative work in planning the basic approach and executing and applying economics to the end result. The Problem The industry has long recognized the intricate complexities of the business called reservoir engineering. The application of the fundamental principles established to date has resulted in a large accumulation of raw data from drilling production and laboratory operations. A normal development program yields voluminous records of electric logging, core analysis, drilling data, laboratory analyses of gas, oil and water, reservoir production of gas, oil and water, reservoir pressures, gas plant reports, etc. The engineer must analyze this information and blend it into the complex array of conservation rules and regulations and general cost and profit economics in order to design the most economic oil recovery process. Faced with this duty, the engineer must find time to perform it responsibly. Routine work must be minimized as much as possible.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Campylobacter jejuni: a computer-aided approach}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) is considered to be one of the most frequent causes of bacterial gastroenteritis globally, especially in young children. The genome of C. jejuni contains many proteins with unknown functions termed as hypothetical proteins (HPs). These proteins might have essential biological role to show the full spectrum of this bacterium. Hence, our study aimed to determine the functions of HPs, pertaining to the genome of C. jejuni. An in-silico work flow integrating various tools were performed for functional assignment, three-dimensional structure determination, domain architecture predictors, subcellular localization, physicochemical characterization, and protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs). Sequences of 267 HPs of C. jejuni were analyzed and successfully attributed the function of 49 HPs with higher confidence. Here, we found proteins with enzymatic activity, transporters, binding and regulatory proteins as well as proteins with biotechnological interest. Assessment of the performance of various tools used in this analysis revealed an accuracy of 95% using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Functional and structural predictions and the results from ROC analyses provided the validity of in-silico tools used in the present study. The approach used for this analysis leads us to assign the function of unknown proteins and relate them with the functions that have already been described in previous literature.}",

Formava-se a vers\u00e3o campinense dos M\u00e3o Branca, que no ano de 1980, aparecia no jornal Di\u00e1rio da Borborema como o justiceiro, algoz de bandidos perigosos, e como supomos, a partir do paradigma indici\u00e1rio de Ginzburg, influenciou o tratamento historiogr\u00e1fico campinense. A partir do momento que a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o das v\u00edtimas passou a reconhec\u00ea-las como pobres marginalizados e/ou delinquentes, sem conjecturar que na realidade, a maioria das v\u00edtimas dos M\u00e3o Branca eram detentos do regime fechado ou semiaberto da Casa de Deten\u00e7\u00e3o de Campina Grande. A an\u00e1lise interpretativa do processo do \u00fanico policial condenado pelos crimes do grupo, Zez\u00e9 Bas\u00edlio, revelou que: inspirados no grupo de exterm\u00ednio carioca, os M\u00e3o Branca campinense, tamb\u00e9m telefonavam para o jornal, indicando a localiza\u00e7\u00e3o dos corpos. No entanto, parecido com o que ocorreu com o Esquadr\u00e3o da Morte paulistano, a atitude da opini\u00e3o p\u00fablica campinense se transformou, a partir da den\u00fancia dos parentes das v\u00edtimas, da sociedade civil e da igreja cat\u00f3lica. Ainda assim, o que nunca foi dito \u00e9 que as v\u00edtimas dos M\u00e3o Branca n\u00e3o eram pessoas perigosas, como exposto nos jornais, mas tamb\u00e9m, n\u00e3o eram apenas pobres marginalizados, como oferecido \u00e0 historiografia, eram detentos da Casa de Deten\u00e7\u00e3o, que retirados de suas celas por Zez\u00e9 Bas\u00edlio e Ci\u00e7o Tom\u00e9, com o pretexto de transferi-los de cela ou para a delegacia distrital, os levavam para a morte, registrada nas mat\u00e9rias de capa do Di\u00e1rio da Borborema, al\u00e9m de outras, que despistassem a pr\u00e1tica.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Geology\", \"Ocean Engineering\", \"Water Science and Technology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [122, 0, 0], "string": "title={Effect of complex circuit exercises on cd34/cd45 stem cells and their relation to health efficiency for water polo players}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Gastroenterology\", \"Hepatology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [93, 0, 2080], "string": "title={The Clinicopathological Characteristics and Prognoses of dMMR Gastric Adenocarcinoma Patients}, container_title={}, abstract={Background. Few studies on the clinicopathological features and prognosis of DNA mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) gastric cancer (GC) have been reported, and no clear conclusions have been drawn about the factors affecting the prognosis of dMMR GC. The aim of this study was to explore the clinicopathological characteristics and prognoses of dMMR GC patients. Methods. From May 2011 to November 2020, GC patients who underwent surgery with dMMR confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) at the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Shanxi Medical University were selected. The patients\u2019 clinical and pathological data were collected. The recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates of the patients were determined through follow-up. SPSS 26.0 was used to analyze the patients\u2019 clinicopathological features and prognoses. Results. A total of 162 dMMR GC patients met the inclusion criteria, and the median age was 63.5 years (32\u201389 years). dMMR GC was more common in males (65% vs. 35%), and most of the cases were stage II (the prevalence of stage I was 22%, that of stage II was 43%, that of stage III was 30%, and that of stage IV was 5%). Most of the lesions were located in the antrum (49%), followed by the cardia (25%). PMS2 and MLH1 (57%) deficiency was most common. Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis showed that factors related to OS were family history ( P = 0.048 ), number of lymph node (LN) metastases ( P 0.001 ), vascular tumor thrombus ( P 0.001 ), HER2 expression status ( P = 0.025 ), and clinical stage ( P 0.001 ). The factors related to RFS included vascular tumor thrombus ( P 0.001 ), number of LN metastases ( P 0.001 ), and clinical stage ( P 0.001 ). Conclusion. In this study, dMMR GC was more common in men, and the median age was 63.5 years. Most of the lesions were in the antrum and showed the combined deletion of MLH1 and PMS2. dMMR GC patients tended to be early stage, and the prognosis of those with early-stage GC was better. dMMR GC patients with vascular tumor thrombus or >6 LN metastases had a high recurrence rate and poor survival outcome.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

The delivery performance of employees varies in different conditions, which further exacerbates the difficulty of order assignment optimization. In this research, a non-linear multi-objective optimization model is proposed with human factor considerations in terms of both deteriorating effect and learning effect, in order to acquire the optimal solutions in practice. The objectives comprised the minimization of the operational cost in multiple periods and the workload balancing among multiple employees. The proposed model is further transformed to a standardized mixed-integer linear model by the exploitation of linearization procedures and normalization operations. Numerical experiments show that the proposed model can be easily solved using commercial optimization softwares. The results indicate that the variance of employee performance can affect the entire delivery performance, and significant improvement of workload balancing can be achieved at the price of slight increase of the operational cost. The proposed model can facilitate the decision-making process of order assignment and workforce scheduling in the food delivery industry. Moreover, it can provide managerial insights for other labor-intensive service-oriented industries.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Psychiatry and Mental Health\"]", "language": "en", "length": [76, 0, 0], "string": "title={Psychiatry, The Pharmaceutical Industry, and The Road to Better Therapeutics}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Economics and Econometrics\", \"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)\"]", "language": "en", "length": [106, 26, 0], "string": "title={Book Review: Beyond Greenwash?

Almost immediately, online news media began publishing details of the earthquake along with pleas for donations of money and other aid. In effect, a disaster-response community had formed in cyberspace. This study explores the role of the news media in the formation of that community. It examines how the online sites of three leading English-language Indian dailies - The Times of India, The Hindu and The Hindustan Times - disseminated information about the disaster to the outside world. The study shows the media followed good professional practices in focusing on human needs and not overemphasising foreign help. The media helped in the formation of a disaster-response community based on common interests as well as a geographic location of concern. This study illustrates the important role the online news media play in bringing together people concerned about one specific issue - in this case, the tragic earthquake in Gujarat.}",

However, many experimental techniques disturb the natural tissue balance, making it difficult to draw realistic conclusions concerningin situcell behaviour. In this study, we present a widely applicable and minimally invasive method which combines fluorescence cell labelling, retrospective image analysis and mathematical data processing to detect the presence and activity of cell subpopulations, using adhesion patterns in STRO-1 immunoselected human mesenchymal populations and the homogeneous osteoblast-like MG63 continuous cell line as an illustration.Adhesion is considered on tissue culture plastic and fibronectin surfaces, using cell area as a readily obtainable and individual cell specific measure of spreading. The underlying statistical distributions of cell areas are investigated and mappings between distributions are examined using a combination of graphical and non-parametric statistical methods. We show that activity can be quantified in subpopulations as small as 1% by cell number, and outline behaviour of significant subpopulations in both STRO-1+/\u2212fractions.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, it has rapidly become evident that the acute infection is not limited to the respiratory tract but that several organs, including the cardiovascular system, can be affected. Moreover, in a significant proportion of patients (ranging from about 10 to up to 50%) with former COVID-19, cardiopulmonary symptoms such as dyspnea, palpitations, restricted physical capacity, and cardiac arrhythmias can persist weeks and months after the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. The spectrum of COVID-19-associated arrhythmias is rather wide, most likely due to various pathomechanisms. In this article, the prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias and underlying pathologies are reviewed, including direct myocardial injury and abnormal consequences with an impact on cardiac electric instability. The hyperinflammatory reaction of the host immune system is specifically considered.

Context Small adjustments in levothyroxine (LT4) dose do not appear to provide clinical benefit despite changes in thyrotropin (TSH) levels within the reference range. We hypothesize that the accompanying changes in serum total triiodothyronine (T3) levels do not reflect the magnitude of the changes in serum TSH. Objective This work aims to characterize the relationships of serum free thyroxine (FT4) vs T3, FT4 vs TSH, and FT4 vs the T3/FT4 ratio. Methods This cross-sectional, observational study comprised 9850 participants aged 18 years and older treated with LT4 from a large clinical database from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2019. Patients had been treated with LT4, subdivided by serum FT4 level. Main outcome measures included model fitting of the relationships between serum FT4 vs TSH, FT4 vs T3, and FT4 vs T3/FT4. Mean and median values of TSH, T3, and T3/FT4 were calculated. Results The relationships T3 vs FT4 and TSH vs FT4 were both complex and best represented by distinct, segmented regression models. Increasing FT4 levels were linearly associated with T3 levels until an inflection point at an FT4 level of 0.7 ng/dL, after which a flattening of the slope was observed following a convex quadratic curve. In contrast, increasing FT4 levels were associated with steep declines in TSH following 2 negative sigmoid curves. The FT4 vs T3/FT4 relationship was fit to an asymptotic regression curve supporting less T4 to T3 activation at higher FT4 levels. Conclusion In LT4-treated patients, the relationships between serum FT4 vs TSH and FT4 vs T3 across a range of FT4 levels are disproportionate. As a result, dose changes in LT4 that robustly modify serum FT4 and TSH values may only minimally affect serum T3 levels and result in no significant clinical benefit.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Philosophy\"]", "language": "en", "length": [80, 0, 0], "string": "title={Taking Other Human Beings Seriously: Rorty's Ethics of Choice and Responsibility}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [56, 0, 0], "string": "title={Intraoperative neuromonitoring in major vascular surgery}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Archeology\", \"History\", \"Archeology\"]", "language": "fr", "length": [63, 0, 0], "string": "title={L'aigle fun\u00e9raire de Syrie et l'apoth\u00e9ose des empereurs romains}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Inorganic Chemistry\", \"Physical and Theoretical Chemistry\"]", "language": "en", "length": [92, 0, 0], "string": "title={A linear RN2 transition metal linkage.

has the advantage of being simple and easy to implement. because its setting remains intuitive and more practical. On the other hand, these disadvantages lie in the fact that most of them reach a compromise in terms of speed of response and stability. Even worse, such an approach becomes insufficient at the increasingly demanding speeds demanded by the industry. in this context the NLPI controller is currently presented as an alternative. With its simple tuning method and robustness to process parameter variations, it stands out as a valuable addition to the toolbox of control engineering specialists.

Single-Center, 6-Year, Retrospective Cohort Study}, container_title={}, abstract={OBJECTIVE. Despite the promising preliminary results observed in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) populations, the use of fluconazole to prevent fungal colonization and infection in preterm neonates in the NICU is still an open question and not yet recommended as a standard of care. We have reviewed our 6-year series to assess the effectiveness and safety of this form of prophylaxis. METHODS. This retrospective study consisted of 465 neonates who weighed &lt;1500 g at birth and were admitted to our NICU in the period 1998\u20132003. Those who were born between 1998 and 2000 and did not receive fluconazole prophylaxis (group A, n = 240) were compared with those who were born between 2001 and 2003 and treated with fluconazole until the 30th day of life (45th for neonates &lt;1000 g at birth; group B, n = 225). Weekly surveillance cultures were obtained from all patients. Incidence of fungal colonization, incidence of systemic fungal infection (SFI), rate of progression from colonization to infection, and mortality rates attributable to fungi were calculated for both groups and separately for neonates who were &lt;1000 g (ELBW) and were 1001 to 1500 g (NE-VLBW) at birth. RESULTS. Overall fungal colonization was significantly lower in group B (24.0%) than in group A (43.8%; relative risk [RR]: 0.406; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.273\u20130.605). The same was true of neonates with colonization in multiple sites (2.6% vs 5.8%) and of those with colonization from high-risk sites (5.8% vs 19.2%). SFI incidence was significantly lower in group B (10 of 225 cases; 4.4%) than in group A (40 of 240 cases; 16.7%; RR: 0.233; 95% CI: 0.113\u20130.447). Reduction of both colonization and SFI in group B was greater in the ELBW neonates and also significant in the NE-VLBW neonates. Rate of progression from colonization to infection was significantly lower in group B (0.17 vs 0.38; RR: 0.369; 95% CI: 0.159\u20130.815). Crude mortality rate attributable to Candida species was 1.7% (4 of 240) in group A vs 0% (0 of 225) in group B. Overall mortality rate (any cause before hospital discharge) was similar in the two groups (11.2% vs 10.6%), but in colonized infants (n = 159), it was significantly lower in group B (3.7% vs 18.1%; RR: 0.174; 95% CI: 0.039\u20130.778). The incidence of natively fluconazole-resistant fungal species did not increase over the years, and patterns of sensitivity to fluconazole remained the same. No adverse reaction related to fluconazole occurred. CONCLUSIONS. Prophylactic fluconazole significantly reduces the incidence of colonization and systemic infection by Candida species in both ELBW and NE-VLBW neonates and decreases the rates of progression from initial colonization to massive colonization and to systemic infection. All VLBW neonates may benefit from fluconazole prophylaxis.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Governing tribalism or Machiavellianism especially at the front-end of projects is absolutely essential for project policy success. But how does a project manager shape a major project policy into success? The purpose of this research is to investigate tribalism and Machiavellianism and implement the necessary governance mechanisms to shape the implementation of project policies to optimize its success. This requires a deep understanding of human relational behavior. A case study approach was adopted that investigated Australia\u2019s largest infrastructure program in history, the AUD $16.2 billion Building the Education Revolution (BER) program, which was plagued with power and politics and Machiavellianism of the project world. Factors such as collective institutional leadership with formal and informal governance mechanisms in rationalizing decisions were identified as essential aspects from the case study.

of cover crop rapeseed}, container_title={}, abstract={AbstractRapeseed is a popular cover crop choice due to its deep-growing taproot, which creates soil macropores and increases water infiltration. Brassicaceae spp. that are mature or at later growth stages can be troublesome to control. Experiments were conducted in Delaware and Virginia to evaluate herbicides for terminating rapeseed cover crops. Two separate experiments, adjacent to each other, were established to evaluate rapeseed termination by 14 herbicide treatments at two timings. Termination timings included an early and late termination to simulate rapeseed termination prior to planting corn and soybean, respectively, for the region. At three locations where rapeseed height averaged 12 cm at early termination and 52 cm at late termination, glyphosate + 2,4-D was most effective, controlling rapeseed 96% 28 d after early termination (DAET). Paraquat + atrazine + mesotrione (92%), glyphosate + saflufenacil (91%), glyphosate + dicamba (91%), and glyphosate (86%) all provided at least 80% control 28 DAET. Rapeseed biomass followed a similar trend. Paraquat + 2,4-D (85%), glyphosate + 2,4-D (82%), and paraquat + atrazine + mesotrione (81%) were the only treatments that provided at least 80% control 28 d after late termination (DALT).

We focus on scalar operators with large conformal dimensions. This allows us to use the geodesic approximation for propagators. In addition to the leading order contribution, captured by geodesics anchored at the insertion points of the operators on the boundary and probing the bulk geometry thoroughly studied in the literature, the first correction is given by a Witten diagram involving both the bulk cubic coupling and the higher curvature couplings. As a result, this correction is proportional to the VEV of a neutral operator Ok and thus probes the interior of the black hole exactly as in the case studied by Grinberg and Maldacena [13]. The form of the correction matches the general expectations in CFT and allows to identify the contributions of TnOk (being Tn the general contraction of n energy-momentum tensors) to the 2-point function. This correction is actually the leading term for off-diagonal correlators (i.e. correlators for operators of different conformal dimension), which can then be computed holographically in this way.}",

abstract={JavaScript is the most popular programming language for client-side Web applications, and Node.js has popularized the language for server-side computing, too. In this domain, the minimal support for parallel programming remains however a major limitation. In this paper we introduce a novel parallel programming abstraction called Generic Messages (GEMs). GEMs allow one to combine message passing and shared-memory parallelism, extending the classes of parallel applications that can be built with Node.js.

An increased number of cases of APPV have been reported in various countries all over the world since 2015. This study aimed to develop an effective subunit vaccine against APPV based on the E2 protein, which is the main immunogenicity protein of APPV. In this study, E2 protein was successfully expressed by the baculovirus expression system. E2 protein was confirmed by Western blot assay, which showed that E2 protein possesses N-linked glycosylation sites. The immunogenicity of E2 subunit vaccine was evaluated in mice. The E2 protein emulsified with ISA 201VG adjuvant induced significantly higher levels of APPV-specific antibodies and elicited stronger lymphocyte proliferative responses and higher interleukin-10 secretion than those of the E2 protein emulsified with IMS 1313VG adjuvant. This observation indicates that the E2 subunit vaccine induces a Th2-type immune response. Our results showed that E2 protein can be developed as a safe and effective subunit vaccine for the control of APPV infection.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health\"]", "language": "en", "length": [88, 0, 0], "string": "title={Occupation and breast cancer risk in Polish women: A population-based case-control study}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Ophthalmology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [34, 33, 0], "string": "title={Endophthalmitis and Contact Lenses}, container_title={American Journal of Ophthalmology}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Public Administration\"]", "language": "en", "length": [120, 0, 0], "string": "title={Economic actions or cultural and social decisions?

G-CSF mobilisation of HSCs requires 4-7 days of injections that are associated with significant side effects and potential for severe complications including disease flares (e.g., scleroderma and multiple sclerosis). MGTA-145 is a biologic that activates CXCR2 on neutrophils, and with plerixafor rapidly mobilises HSCs in mice and non-human primates. The combination promises to be a same-day, G-CSF-free mobilisation regimen.Objectives:To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and mobilisation efficacy of MGTA-145 monotherapy and combination therapy with plerixafor in healthy volunteers.Methods:This healthy volunteer phase 1 study consisted of 4 parts- Part A: single-agent MGTA-145 or placebo; Part B: MGTA-145 or placebo given immediately or 2 hours after plerixafor; Part C: MGTA-145 or placebo given 2 hours after plerixafor on 2 consecutive days; Part D: MGTA-145 given 2 hours after plerixafor, just prior to apheresis cell collection.Results:Monotherapy of MGTA-145 mobilised CD34+ cells within minutes and peaked within 1 hour post MGTA-145 (median 11 CD34+ cells/\u00b5L, a 7-fold increase vs baseline). White blood cells and neutrophils followed a similar pattern. Importantly, markers of neutrophil activation were relatively unchanged (\u22642-fold vs baseline).MGTA-145 combined with plerixafor increased CD34+ cell mobilisation, whether given simultaneously or 2h after plerixafor (Fig. 1A). Mobilisation was highly enriched for CD34+CD90+CD45RA- HSCs, which tracked closely with the total CD34 count. At the 0.03 mg/kg dose with 2h stagger, median peak CD34+ peripheral blood mobilisation was \u226540 cells/\u00b5L in Part B. On a second consecutive day of dosing, MGTA-145 + plerixafor mobilises HSCs to levels comparable to day 1. Initial data from the ongoing Part D show that sufficient numbers of cells (median 4.3 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg) for transplant were collected in a single day.. Preliminary data from NSG mouse transplant studies of those mobilised HSCs in part D show higher engraftment rates of MGTA-145 + plerixafor mobilised HSCs, compared to G-CSF-mobilised HSCs.Figure.Peripheral blood mobilisation after plerixafor + 0.03 mg/kg MGTA-145 in healthy subjects with simultaneous and 2h stagger dosing after plerixafor. Dotted line: previously reported CD34+ counts with plerixafor alone mobilisation (Chenet al,Blood Advances. 2018).MGTA-145 monotherapy was well tolerated with no significant adverse events (AEs). Grade 1, transient lower back pain that dissipated within minutes was reported. The combination of MGTA-145 with plerixafor was well tolerated, with some subjects experiencing grade 1/2 gastrointestinal AEs commonly observed with plerixafor and one grade 2 back pain with MGTA-145 at 0.075 mg/kg that resolved within minutes.Conclusion:MGTA-145 monotherapy was well-tolerated and induced rapid mobilisation of significant numbers of HSCs. CD34+ cell mobilisation with MGTA-145 + plerixafor was immediate and superior to plerixafor alone. These data suggest that the combination can enable the collection of sufficient HSCs for transplant in one day without the need for G-CSF. Further development as a first line mobilisation product is warranted in autoimmune diseases, gene therapy and haematologic malignancies.Table.Single-day Mobilisation and Apheresis Cell Yields in Part DSubjectTotal CD34+ Yield (x106 cells)CD34+/kg (x106 cells)CD90+ (%)8013194.139%8073224.441%8175005.326%821 (*completed only 13L of planned 20L collection)2392.719%Median3214.333%Disclosure of Interests:John Dipersio Shareholder of: Magenta, Consultant of: Cellworks, Tioma, Rivervest, Bioline, Asterias, Amphivena and Bluebird, Celgene, Incyte, NeoImuneTech, Macrogenics, Steven Devine: None declared, Jonathan Hoggatt Shareholder of: Magenta, Grant/research support from: Magenta, Consultant of: Magenta, David Scadden Shareholder of: Magenta, Consultant of: Magenta, Haley Howell Shareholder of: Magenta, Employee of: Magenta, Veit Schmelmer Shareholder of: Magenta, Employee of: Magenta, Jason Neale Shareholder of: Magenta, Employee of: Magenta, Tony Boitano Shareholder of: Magenta, Employee of: Magenta, Michael Cooke Shareholder of: Magenta, Employee of: Magenta, Dwight Morrow Shareholder of: Magenta, Employee of: Magenta, Glen Raffel Shareholder of: Magenta, Employee of: Magenta, Will Savage Shareholder of: Magenta, Employee of: Magenta, Kevin Goncalves Shareholder of: Magenta, Employee of: Magenta, Pat Falahee Shareholder of: Magenta, Employee of: Magenta, John Davis Shareholder of: Magenta, Employee of: Magenta}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging\", \"Internal Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [160, 0, 1733], "string": "title={Correlations of obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS) grade, specific symptoms of anal incontinence, and measurements by endoanal and transperineal ultrasound}, container_title={}, abstract={AbstractPurposeThe aim of the study was to investigate the association between the initial grade of obstetrical anal sphincter injury (OASIS), and Wexner score parameters, with ultrasonographic findings by endoanal ultrasound (EAUS, golden standard) and transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) 6 months post-partum.MethodsFifty-nine women after primary repair of OASIS were included at Helsingborg Hospital, Sweden, 2016\u20132017. Six months post-partum the women filled in a questionnaire regarding symptoms of anal incontinence by the Wexner score and were scanned with EAUS and TPUS (resting state and contracting state) for classification of the residual defect by a modified Starck score.ResultsCorrelations were found between the OASIS grade and residual defects; length (rs = 0.41,P = 0.003), depth (rs = 0.38,P = 0.006) and angle (rs = 0.40,P = 0.004) of the external anal sphincter (EAS) measured with TPUS in resting state. Using EAUS, correlation between OASIS grade and EAS depth (rs = 0.35,P = 0.007) and angle (rs = 0.37,P = 0.004) were similar, but there was no correlation with length (rs = 0.20,P = 0.14). Between incontinence to gas and the angle of the residual defect in the IAS using TPUS in resting state, correlation was moderate (rs = 0.42,P = 0.003). Regarding incontinence to liquid stool, measurements by TPUS in resting state of EAS residual defect depth (rs = 0.46,P rs = 0.44,P = 0.001) also correlated moderately. Both corresponding correlations using EAUS were weaker.ConclusionDefects measured with EAUS and TPUS six months post-partum correlated to initial OASIS grade and symptoms of anal incontinence. Specific symptoms correlated with specific anatomical defects, and TPUS was not an inferior method to EAUS.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Logic\", \"Philosophy\"]", "language": "en", "length": [131, 0, 0], "string": "title={Andrew Paul Ushenko.

Eosinophils are traditionally known as cytotoxic effector cells but have been suggested to additionally play a role in immunomodulation and maintenance of homeostasis. The exact role of these granule-containing leukocytes in health and diseases is still a matter of debate. Degranulation is one of the key effector functions of eosinophils in response to diverse stimuli. The different degranulation patterns occurring in eosinophils (piecemeal degranulation, exocytosis and cytolysis) have been extensively studied in the last few years.

steps during data collection whether sufficient evidence has accrued to make a decision about the tested hypotheses. As soon as sufficient information has been obtained, data collection is terminated. Here, we compare two sequential hypothesis testing procedures that have recently been proposed for use in psychological research: Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT;Psychological Methods, 25(2), 206\u2013226, 2020) and the Sequential Bayes Factor Test (SBFT;Psychological Methods, 22(2), 322\u2013339, 2017). We show that although the two methods have different philosophical roots, they share many similarities and can even be mathematically regarded as two instances of an overarching hypothesis testing framework. We demonstrate that the two methods use the same mechanisms for evidence monitoring and error control, and that differences in efficiency between the methods depend on the exact specification of the statistical models involved, as well as on the population truth. Our simulations indicate that when deciding on a sequential design within a unified sequential testing framework, researchers need to balance the needs of test efficiency, robustness against model misspecification, and appropriate uncertainty quantification. We provide guidance for navigating these design decisions based on individual preferences and simulation-based design analyses.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Development\", \"Geography, Planning and Development\"]", "language": "en", "length": [12, 0, 0], "string": "title={Book Reviews}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Plant Science\"]", "language": "en", "length": [104, 26, 2064], "string": "title={Effect of Humic Acid Addition on Buffering Capacity and Nutrient Storage Capacity of Soilless Substrates}, container_title={Frontiers in Plant Science}, abstract={Excessive application of fertilizers has become a major issue in croplands of intensive agricultural systems in China, resulting in severe non-point source pollution; thus, reduction in the use of chemical fertilizers has received significant attention. Improving the nutrient storage capacity of soils or substrates is an effective approach for solving this problem. Humic acids (HA) are excellent soil conditioners. Thus, in the present study, their ability to improve the physico-chemical properties of three substrates with different textures was evaluated. HA treatments included 1% HA root application in three different types of substrates, including pure sand, pure cocopeat, and a mixture of sand:cocopeat (1:1, v/v) and their relative controls. We examined the morphological parameters of cucumber seedlings as well as pH buffering capacity (pHBC), total organic carbon (TOC), organic matter (OM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and nutrient storage capacity of the three substrates. The results show that HA application improved the morphological parameters of cucumber seedlings (plant height, stem diameter, and biomass) in pure cocopeat and cocopeat-sand mixture treatments. On the contrary, HA addition had harmful effects on the cucumber seedlings cultivated in sand due to the low pHBC of sand. The seedlings cultivated in pure cocopeat showed the best morphological parameter performances among the seedlings grown in the three substrates. Furthermore, pHBC, TOC, OM, and CEC were enhanced by HA application. Incorporation of HA improved ammonium (NH4+) and potassium (K+) storage capacity while decreasing phosphorus (P) storage. Pure cocopeat had the highest pHBC, TOC, OM, CEC, and nutrient storage capacity among the three substrates. In conclusion, mixing 1% HA into substrates promoted cucumber growth, improved substrate properties, and enhanced fertilizer use efficiency. Pure cocopeat is a suitable substrate for cucumber cultivation, and mixing cocopeat with sand amends the substrate properties and consequently improves plant growth.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology\", \"Fuel Technology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [130, 44, 0], "string": "title={Measurement of Oil-CO2 diffusion coefficient using pulse-echo method for pressure-volume decay approach under reservoir conditions}, container_title={Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Genetics (clinical)\", \"Neurology (clinical)\", \"Neurology\", \"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health\"]", "language": "en", "length": [70, 0, 0], "string": "title={Longterm treatment in myasthenia gravis with IVIG: Preliminary results}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Psychiatry and Mental Health\", \"Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [79, 0, 1181], "string": "title={Analisis Pengangguran Usia Muda di Pulau Jawa Sebelum dan Saat Pandemi Covid-19}, container_title={}, abstract={The Covid-19 pandemic has harmed the employment sector.

The island of Java was chosen as the research locus because it is the area most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in Indonesia. To achieve these objectives, we used the binary logistic regression analysis method with interaction effect. The results showed that gender, residency, education level, graduation time, marital status, work experience, and migration status affected the youth unemployment status in Java before and during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The shortest path network suggests that the role of a mixed anxiety-depressive symptomatology, and specific and non-specific symptoms of clinical criteria, such as \u201cworries,\u201d \u201cfeels depressed,\u201d \u201cfears school,\u201d and \u201ctalks about suicide\u201d could serve as a warning for comorbidity.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Algebra and Number Theory\"]", "language": "en", "length": [72, 19, 0], "string": "title={The isomorphism problem for varieties generated by a two-element algebra}, container_title={Algebra Universalis}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Development\", \"Geography, Planning and Development\"]", "language": "en", "length": [90, 10, 639], "string": "title={Western Economic Sanctions against Russia: an Opportunity for Closer Eurasian Integration?}, container_title={Orientando}, abstract={The policy implemented by the Russian Federation over the past five years has been significantly independent from the contemporary world order\u2019s approach, which led to Russia being relatively isolated from the international community.

patients underwent emergent pulmonary artery thrombectomy for massive and submassive PE using ART with pharmacological and procedural modification, in comparison to prior reports. The modifications included the selective use of the Solent Omni AngioJet device in all subjects, distal contrast angiography via the AngioJet catheter before device activation, and limited short run times. Thrombolytic therapy was not used in any patient. Patients were monitored for short- and long-term outcomes. Long-term clinical follow-up and evaluation for persistent pulmonary hypertension with echocardiography was performed.ResultsThe pharmacological and procedural modifications resulted in a favorable clinical response without any major complications and without any mortality. Procedure-related anemia (mean hemoglobin drop of 0.49 g/dl) was the only significant minor complication noted. There were no bleeding complications and no transfusion requirement. On a six-month follow-up, there was no mortality, and there were significant reductions in the pulmonary artery pressures.ConclusionMajor and minor complications were reduced compared to prior reports using ART. A modified ART approach towards treatment of high-risk PE appears promising both in terms of efficacy and safety.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

signals that the next revolution would be related to social networking. Social networking services (SNS) have grown after MySpace, LinkedIn and Facebook were launched in 2003- 2004 and combine text, images, movies, music, animations and all sorts of lists to create personal presentation pages for users, means to connect to real or virtual friends from all over the world and recommendations based on trust. The rise of the Social Semantic Web and the convergence of different media to create rich experiences is one of the most interesting paradigm shift in the last decades because the probable effect of this movement is the fact that in one day virtual meetings will become legitimate in all aspects of our daily lives (if they are not already). The most important question in this context (the one that we try to answer in this paper) is related to how people will try to shape and use their avatars. In order to understand this, we will study the links between multimodal ontologies, affective interfaces, social data portability and other recent findings. This paper starts with a survey of the current literature of the field, examines some social semantic web mechanisms that changed the way we think about SNs and in the end discusses some methods of connecting emotions with the social semantic web which pose some interesting questions related to the use of avatars. Between conclusions, one of the most interesting is the one that states that the use of affective interfaces adds value to the multimodal ontologies, while another suggests that the avatar must be a mediator between different technologies.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

The business viewpoint has brought fundamental shifts in how things are done, and as Larry N.

For managers, performance is the bottom line, and it is reflected in numbers\u2014numbers of book circulated, numbers of books requested that are available in a given library, numbers of users of one collection of books within a library vis\u2010a\u2010vis other collections, even the cost of keeping a book in the library for a year figured by dividing the library budget by the number of volumes on the shelves.

Home intravenous replacement of missing clotting factor is the most effective treatment; however, the uptake of preventative treatment (also known as prophylaxis) varies among men with hemophilia. The purpose of the current qualitative study was to describe the connections between masculinities and men\u2019s ( n = 11) experiences of hemophilia across varying age groups. The inductively derived findings revealed bleed-related joint pain as the primary prompt for men to treat or seek medical help. Many men reported experiencing a high number of bleed-related injuries in adolescence, particularly in high school, oftentimes as a result of engaging in idealized masculine physical activities. Though the limitations imposed by hemophilia were contested by most men early on in their lives, as men grow older more conservative approaches were employed both in terms of treatment and activity to reduce the potential for residual bleed-related disabilities. Overall, the results indicate that men with hemophilia may benefit from peer and professional education about recognition, prevention, and optimal treatment of bleeds. Furthermore, masculine ideals act as important context in which men navigate hemophilia management practices and may facilitate contesting or conceding behaviors. Masculine ideals of strength and control may be garnered to facilitate optimal hemophilia management practices.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Snowstorm: Dynamics of the Secondary Circulation}, container_title={}, abstract={Intense lake-effect snowfall results from a long-lake-axis-parallel (LLAP) precipitation band that often forms when the flow is parallel to the long axis of an elongated body of water, such as Lake Ontario. The intensity and persistence of the localized precipitation along the downwind shore and farther inland suggests the presence of a secondary circulation that helps organize such a band, and maintain it for some time as the circulation is advected inland. Unique airborne vertical-plane dual-Doppler radar data are used here to document this secondary circulation in a deep, well-organized LLAP band observed during intensive observing period (IOP) 2b of the Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems (OWLeS) field campaign. The circulation, centered on a convective updraft, intensified toward the downwind shore and only gradually weakened inland. The question arises as to what sustains such a circulation in the vertical plane across the LLAP band. WRF Model simulations indicate that the primary LLAP band and other convergence zones observed over Lake Ontario during this IOP were initiated by relatively shallow airmass boundaries, resulting from a thermal contrast (i.e., land-breeze front) and differential surface roughness across the southern shoreline. Airborne radar data near the downwind shore of the lake indicate that the secondary circulation was much deeper than these shallow boundaries and was sustained primarily by rather symmetric solenoidal forcing, enhanced by latent heat release within the updraft region.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Electricity, computing hardware, and internet networks are vital for health facility\u2013based information systems. Availability of these infrastructures at health facilities is crucial for achieving national digital health visions. Objective The aim of this study was to gain insight into the state of computing hardware, electricity, and connectivity infrastructure at health facilities in Sierra Leone using a representative sample. Methods Stratified sampling of 72 (out of 1284) health facilities distributed in all districts of Sierra Leone was performed, factoring in the rural-urban divide, digital health activity, health facility type, and health facility ownership. Enumerators visited each health facility over a 2-week period. Results Among the 72 surveyed health facilities, 59 (82%) do not have institutionally provided internet. Among the 15 Maternal and Child Health Posts, as a type of primary health care unit (PHU), 9 (60%) use solar energy as their only electricity source and the other 6 (40%) have no electricity source. Similarly, among the 13 hospitals, 5 (38%) use a generator as a primary electricity source. All hospitals have at least one functional computer, although only 7 of the 13 hospitals have four or more functional computers. Similarly, only 2 of the 59 (3%) PHUs have one computer each, and 37 (63%) of the PHUs have one tablet device each. We consider this health care computing infrastructure mapping to be representative with a 95% confidence level within an 11% margin of error. Two-thirds of the PHUs have only alternate solar electricity, only 10 of the 72 surveyed health facilities have functional official internet, and most use suboptimal computing hardware. Overall, 43% of the surveyed health facilities believe that inadequate electricity is the biggest threat to digitization. Similarly, 16 (22%) of the 72 respondents stated that device theft is a primary hindrance to digitization. Conclusions Electricity provision for off-electricity-grid health facilities using alternative and renewable energy sources is emerging.

Epoetin-beta pegol (C.E.R.A.) is a continuous erythropoietin receptor activator created by integrating a large methoxy-polyethylene-glycol-polymer chain into the erythropoietin molecule, which provides it with a longer half-life. On rare occasions, cases of antibody-mediated pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) related to ESAs are reported. They are characterized by abrupt onset of severe transfusion-dependent anemia, despite ESA therapy. We herein report a case of antibody-mediated PRCA in a dialysis patient receiving C.E.R.A. Case presentation A 44-year-old man with end-stage renal failure had been receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis for 2 years. C.E.R.A. was administered subcutaneously as a sole ESA once a month at the hospital since 4 years ago for the treatment of renal anemia and his hemoglobin level was well controlled at 12 g/dl. From 10 months before diagnosis, however, his hemoglobin level suddenly declined, necessitating frequent transfusions. Based on the results of a bone marrow examination and detection of anti-C.E.R.A. antibodies, the patient was diagnosed with antibody-mediated PRCA. After successful elimination of the antibodies using oral prednisolone plus cyclosporine, the patient was re-administrated C.E.R.A. intravenously, as there are few reports of antibody-mediated PRCA related to ESA using that administration route. He responded to the C.E.R.A., and his anemia dramatically improved, eliminating the need for blood transfusions. Conclusions This is the first reported case of recovery from an antibody-mediated PRCA with C.E.R.A. after its re-administration following a reversal of the antibody. It has been suggested that the additional large pegylation chain makes C.E.R.A. less likely to trigger antibody generation than other ESAs. Following successful treatment of antibody-mediated PRCA using immunosuppressive therapy, C.E.R.A. can be re-administered intravenously to treat renal anemia.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

The available software solutions on the market can force customers to adopt one particular ecosystem of products, thus limiting consumer choice, and are often incapable of operating independently of the grid during blackouts. In this paper, we present the \u201cSolar+ Optimizer\u201d (SPO), a control platform that provides demand flexibility, resiliency and reduced utility bills, built using open-source software. SPO employs Model Predictive Control (MPC) to produce real time optimal control strategies for the building loads and the distributed energy resources on site. SPO is designed to be vendor-agnostic, protocol-independent and resilient to loss of wide-area network connectivity. The software was evaluated in a real convenience store in northern California with on-site solar generation, battery storage and control of HVAC and commercial refrigeration loads. Preliminary tests showed price responsiveness of the building and cost savings of more than 10% in energy costs alone.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

container_title={}, abstract={ABSTRACT Ras is a highly conserved GTPase protein that is essential for proper polarized morphogenesis of filamentous fungi. Localization of Ras proteins to the plasma membrane and endomembranes through posttranslational addition of farnesyl and palmitoyl residues is an important mechanism through which cells provide specificity to Ras signal output. Although the Aspergillus fumigatus RasA protein is known to be a major regulator of growth and development, the membrane distribution of RasA during polarized morphogenesis and the role of properly localized Ras signaling in virulence of a pathogenic mold remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that Aspergillus fumigatus RasA localizes primarily to the plasma membrane of actively growing hyphae. We show that treatment with the palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate disrupts normal RasA plasma membrane association and decreases hyphal growth. Targeted mutations of the highly conserved RasA palmitoylation motif also mislocalized RasA from the plasma membrane and led to severe hyphal abnormalities, cell wall structural changes, and reduced virulence in murine invasive aspergillosis. Finally, we provide evidence that proper RasA localization is independent of the Ras palmitoyltransferase homolog, encoded by erfB , but requires the palmitoyltransferase complex subunit, encoded by erfD . Our results demonstrate that plasma membrane-associated RasA is critical for polarized morphogenesis, cell wall stability, and virulence in A. fumigatus .}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Law\"]", "language": "en", "length": [82, 0, 0], "string": "title={Amenability of Foreign Administrators to Suit under Non-Resident Motorist Statutes}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Organic Chemistry\", \"Catalysis\"]", "language": "en", "length": [86, 9, 0], "string": "title={A Simple Method for the Preparation of Diphenylmethyl Esters ofN-Protected Amino Acids}, container_title={Synthesis}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [131, 0, 0], "string": "title={The Pauropoda and Symphyla of the Geneva Museum IX.

The study was based on fieldwork that resulted in 869 new collections gathered between 2013 and 2017 in the country and on yet existing herbarium specimens kept at the Herbaria of Lom\u00e9 and Paris. Thus, a total number of 1092 specimens collected throughout the country served as a basis for this work, to which were added the known, published occurrences of Pteridophytes for the country. At the end of this study, a total diversity of 134 species belonging to 53 genera and 25 families and 12 orders were recorded and documented for the country.

The results are discussed in terms of assisting families to meet self-identified needs before asking them to carry out professionally prescribed child-level treatments as part of their involvement in early intervention programs.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Metals and Alloys\", \"Mechanical Engineering\", \"Mechanics of Materials\", \"Building and Construction\", \"Civil and Structural Engineering\"]", "language": "de", "length": [95, 0, 0], "string": "title={Hermann-Liebmann-Br\u00fccke in Leipzig - Herstellung mit Spannverbund-Tr\u00e4gern in geteilter Bauweise}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Biochemistry\"]", "language": "en", "length": [188, 0, 0], "string": "title={Mechanistic Crystallography.

Production}, container_title={}, abstract={AbstractThe development of early-maturing soybean [Glycine max(L.) Merr.] varieties has led to an increase in soybean production in canola (Brassica napusL.)-dominant crop rotations in western Canada. Herbicide-resistant (HR) volunteerB. napuscan be difficult to manage in HR soybean using herbicides alone. In 2013 and 2014, four field experiments were conducted in Manitoba, Canada, to evaluate soybean row spacing, seeding density, nitrogen supply, and interrow tillage as candidate nonchemical weed management tools for an integrated program to manage volunteerB. napusin soybean. Among treatments and sites, volunteerB. napusproduced about 830 seeds plant\u22121and resulted in large seedbank inputs (averaging about 20,300 seeds m\u22122). VolunteerB. napusseedling recruitment differed among sites, and resulted in two distinct classes of sites based on average seedling densities of 39 and 89 plants m\u22122. Weed management tools were more effective at the sites with higher volunteerB. napusdensities. At these sites, soybean yield was greater when using an increased soybean-seeding density (44% greater yield using a seeding density of 682,500 vs. 455,000 seeds ha\u22121) or interrow tillage (36% greater yield with vs. without using interrow tillage). Soybean row spacing (19 vs. 38 vs. 76 cm) did not affect soybean yield, unless the reduction in row spacing was combined with an increased seeding density (65% greater yield with narrow-row soybean seeded at 682,500 vs. wide-row soybean seeded at 455,000 seeds ha\u22121). At the sites with higher volunteerB. napusdensities, seed production of canola volunteerB. napuswas greater when nitrogen fertilizer was applied to simulate an environment with greater nitrogen supply (77% greater number of volunteerB. napusseeds produced with vs. without broadcast application of 23 kg N ha\u22121urea). In northern climates, seeding soybean at increased densities using narrow-row spacing in fields with limited soil inorganic nitrogen and using interrow tillage in wide-row production systems are effective strategies that could augment chemical weed management in an integrated program for management of volunteerB. napus, and perhaps also other competitive early-season weeds.}",

Setiadi AE, Rahayu HM. 2021. Reptiles in the Pontianak and Kubu Raya Residental Area, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 22: 2763-2770. The increase in population is directly proportional to housing needs. Expansion of residential areas can threaten the diversity of reptiles in West Kalimantan. This study aims to inventory and identify the diversity of reptiles in residential areas in Pontianak and Kubu Raya, West Kalimantan province, Indonesia. This research gives a better understanding of reptilian urban species to support monitoring and evaluation of biodiversity in West Kalimantan. This research uses the descriptive exploratory method. Four study areas were selected based on a proportion of impervious surfaces. Data collection used the VES (Visual Encounter Survey). Identification refers to Reptile field guides and identification books. The data were analyzed descriptively qualitatively, the level reptile diversity was analyzed using the Shannon Diversity Index, and the similarities of reptiles between the residential area in Pontianak and Kubu Raya were assessed using the Jaccard similarity coefficient. The results showed, from 50 individual reptiles found in Pontianak and Kubu Raya, there were 13 reptile species from the order Squamata and the order Testudines. The Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index of 2.26 and Jaccard similarity coefficient 0.384, indicating that the level of diversity of reptile species in the two study areas is classified as moderate.}",

These results led to the EXPOSE-R mission to extend and refine these experiments as part of the experimental package for the external platform space exposure facility on the ISS. The experiment was flown in February 2009 and the organisms were exposed to low-Earth orbit for nearly 2 years. Samples were either exposed to solar ultraviolet (UV)-radiation (\u03bb > 110 nm or \u03bb > 200 nm, cosmic radiation (dosage range 225\u2013320 mGy), or kept in darkness shielded from solar UV-radiation. Half of each of the UV-radiation exposed samples and dark samples were exposed to space vacuum and half kept at 105pascals in argon. Duplicate samples were kept in the laboratory to serve as unexposed controls. Ground simulation control experiments were also performed. After retrieval, organism viability was tested using Molecular Probes Live\u2013Dead Bac-Lite stain and by their reproduction capability. Samples kept in the dark, but exposed to space vacuum had a 90 \u00b1 5% survival rate compared to the ground controls. Samples exposed to full UV-radiation for over a year were bleached and although results from Molecular Probes Live\u2013Dead stain suggested ~10% survival, the data indicate that no survival was detected using cell growth and division using the most probable number method. Those samples exposed to attenuated UV-radiation exhibited limited survival. Results from of this study are relevant to understanding adaptation and evolution of life, the future of life beyond earth, the potential for interplanetary transfer of viable microbes via meteorites and dust particles as well as spacecraft, and the physiology of halophiles.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Here, by integrating multiple dimensional pharmacogenomic data of 11,950 lncRNA in 5,605 tumors and 1,005 cancer cell lines, we build lncRNA drug response models for 265 anti-cancer compounds across 27 cancer types. Our study reveals the cancer cell lines can realistically recapitulate patient tumors in IncRNA genomic and epigenetic alterations. Using Elastic Net (EN) regression model combined with bootstrap cross validation, our analysis identified 162,327 unique lncRNA-drug interactions. The robustness of lncRNA based EN-models is validated by independent cancer cell line drug response data. By applying lncRNA EN-models of 49 FDA approved drugs to TCGA pan-cancer patient samples across 21 caner types, we have shown that the cancer cell line based EN-models could readily predict chemotherapy responses in patients with breast, stomach, thyroid, and colon rectal cancer. Further lncRNA-protein coding gene co-expression analysis reveals that drug-predictive lncRNAs regulated drug-metabolism and drug-target pathways, which provide underlying mechanism for lncRNAs' regulation of drug response. This analysis has identified a novel intergenic lncRNA, EPIC1, regulates breast cancer tumorigenesis and iBET (Bromodomain Inhibitors) resistance through directly interacting with MYC and regulating MYC transcriptional activity. Knockdown of EPIC1 in breast cancer cells leads to inhibition of colony formation, cell cycle arrest, and suppression of tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of EPIC1 increased MYC target expression, breast tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo, and promote iBET resistance in breast cancer. Mechanistically, EPIC1 directly interacts with MYC through EPIC1's 129-283 nt region. EPIC1 knockdown reduces the occupancy of MYC protein to the promoters of its target genes (e.g., p21, CCNA2, CDC20, and CDC45) without influencing MYC expression. The oncogenic effect of EPIC1 can be abolished by MYC knockdown. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to link noncoding genotypes with drug response phenotypes in both cancer cell lines and patient tumors.

This has clearly entered the political arena, and I purposely steer away from political subjects even though they may have a profound effect on the industry in which I have spent several decades (six plus).}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)\"]", "language": "en", "length": [53, 0, 0], "string": "title={A mass shell with flat interior cannot rotate rigidly}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Education\"]", "language": "en", "length": [75, 0, 0], "string": "title={'All the Evidence Shows \u2026': Reasonable expectations of educational research}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Microbiology (medical)\", \"Microbiology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [159, 0, 1179], "string": "title={Bacterial and fungal coinfections among patients with COVID-19 in Zanjan, Northwest of Iran; a single-center observational with meta-analysis of the literature}, container_title={}, abstract={Background and Objectives: There is a poor understanding about the prevalence and characteristics of secondary bacterial and fungal infections among Coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) superinfection in hospitalized patients.

We identified 89 genes that were up-regulated as well as 54 genes that were down-regulated in blast crisis of CML. The expression profile included oncogenes, tumor suppression genes, and human genes encoding proteins involved in transcription, signal transduction, metabolism, cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis and immune functions. 18 genes were selected among the up-regulated group for analysis using real-time PCR. Real-time PCR data indicated that the expression of FLT3 (p &lt; 0.001), CD32 (p &lt; 0.001), ERG (p &lt; 0.001), uPAR (p &lt; 0.001), MAD (p &lt; 0.001) and TAP2 (p &lt; 0.001) showed statistically significant difference between chronic phase and blast crisis. For further analysis, we utilized small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), also referred to as small interfering RNAs, to target human FLT3. These small interfering RNA constructs significantly inhibited FLT3 expression at mRNA and protein levels in K562 cells. After treating both the FLT3 knockdown cells and control cells (FLT3 wild type) with STI571, MTT assay and the expression patterns of apoptosis related genes (PARP, caspase-3, Bax) were examined. MTT assay and caspase-3 activity assay showed that silencing of the gene for FLT3 significantly reduced cell viability and ultimately facilitated the induction of apoptotic cell death by STI571. These findings uncovered evidence of a complex signaling network operating down-stream of FLT3 that actively contributes to tumor progression. Thus, RNA interference-directed targeting of FLT3 can be a potential candidate anticancer agent in association with STI571 against chronic myeloid leukemia.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
