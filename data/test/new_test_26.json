As regards the RTM process for complicated components, the optimal fabrication process is found by repeated trial and error. This process is time consuming and one of the reasons for the high cost of composite products. To overcome this problem, it is useful to monitor the degree of cure of target GFRP products. In this study, the luminance change method is used for cure monitoring of polyester-based composites. Polyester resin is normally used as the matrix resin for low-cost GFRP products. Polyester resin usually changes its optical transparency during the curing process. This enables us to monitor the degree of cure by measuring the luminance change of light or reflected light. In this study, we present a system that measures reflected light. The sensing system employs an LED as the light source and a photodiode as a light power sensor. This low-cost cure monitoring system is applied to the monitoring of the degree of cure in GFRPs and is achieved using commercially available dielectric sensors. Results are compared with the results of luminance change. The effectiveness of this method has been confirmed experimentally.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

fuels. The drawbacks associated with use of vegetable oils in diesel engines such as high viscosity and low volatility can be reduced to some extent by converting them into biodiesel. However, they (biodiesel) cause combustion problems in diesel engine, due to their moderate viscosity, and hence call for low heat rejection (LHR) engine, which can burn low calorific value fuel, give high heat release rate and faster rate of combustion. The concept of LHR engine is to minimize heat loss to the coolant, thereby increasing thermal efficiency. LHR engine in this investigation consisted of ceramic coated diesel engine. They are many methods toinduct gaseous fuels such as port injection, carburetion technique, injection of gaseous fuel at the near endof compression stroke etc,. Investigations were carried out with biogas gas as primary fuel inducted by port injection and cottonseed biodiesel was injected into the engine in conventional manner, as India is second large producer of cottonseed oil in the world. Particulate matter (PM), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon mono oxide (CO) levels and un-burnt hydro carbons (UBHC) are the exhaust emissions from a diesel engine. They cause health hazards, once they are inhaled in. They also cause environmental effects like Green-house effect and Global Warming. Hence control of these emissions is an immediate effect and an urgent step. The pollutants of PM, NOx ,CO and UBHC were determined at full load operation of the engine with varied injection timing such as recommended injection timing and optimum injection timing. NOx levels were reduced with provision of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) at optimum flow rate of 10%. The maximum induction of biogas with conventional engine (CE) was 35% of total mass of biodiesel as full load operation, while it was 45% with LHR engine. Particulate emissions were determined by AVL Smoke meter, while other emissions were measured by Netel Chromatograph multi-gas analyzer at full load operation. These pollutants were drastically reduced with induction of biogas and further reduced with advanced injection timing.

abstract={SUMMARYTwo trials were carried out to investigate the effects of increasing calorie: protein (C:P) ratios of high iso-nitrogenous diets on the performance characteristics, nutrient digestibility, carcass quality and organ weights of 67 growing pigs of the Yorkshire and Landrace breeds, reared in a tropical environment on concrete-floored pens from 9 to 56-8 kg live weight before slaughtering and grading. The dietary protein content was approximately 24 % of dry matter in all cases, and the C:P ratios ranged from 153 to 184 kcal digestible energy/g in both trials. Results showed no consistently significant differences in gain and feed intake due to increasing C:P ratio, but feed conversion ratios consistently improved with increasing C:P ratio. Digestible energy consumed per kg of body weight gained also increased with increasing C:P ratio. The nutrient digestion coefficients did not appear to be significantly affected by the C:P ratio.

Biologiya}, abstract={Against the general background of an increase in global temperature and spatiotemporal rearrangements in the distribution of precipitations in the 20th century, there are significant changes in the structure and properties of terrestrial ecosystems at all levels of biosphere organization, while their carbon-depositing role is widely discussed in connection with an increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) in the last century. In the massif of the Kraka mountains (South Urals), extrazonal mountain (petrophytic) steppes are located on the southern, highly insolated slopes of the ridges, where peculiar harsh conditions are formed that restrict the growth of woody plants. Due to climate change, forests are expanding to mountain steppes and their area is increasing. The aim of our research is to study the contemporary structure of tree stands and the features of their phytomass accumulation in the transition zone between the forest and mountain steppes on the slopes of the Kraka mountains (53\u00b015\u2032 \u2013 53\u00b050\u2032N, 57\u00b0 36\u2032 \u2013 58\u00b012\u2032E), as well as to assess their changes in the last decades (See Fig. 1). In the massifs of the North and South Kraka mountains on the forest-mountain steppe ecotone, 8 altitudinal transects were installed, with division into levels depending on the crown density: the upper (first) \u2013 at the upper border of the sparse tree stands (groups of trees with crown density 0.05\u20130.1), middle (second) \u2013 at the upper border of open forests (crown density 0.2\u20130.3), lower (third) \u2013 at the upper border of closed forests (crown density 0.4\u20130.5). At the lower and middle altitudinal levels, 3 plots with a size of 20 \u00d7 20 m were installed. At the upper level, polygons were set up in the form of a rectangle with a size of 1-3 hectares. On Bashart Mount, a polygon profile was installed, without division into levels due to the mosaic distribution of trees along the entire profile. For each tree, the following parameters were determined: height, trunk diameter at the base and at a height of 1.3 m, crown projection diameter in two directions, and vital state. To determine the age of trees with a diameter of more than 3 cm, a bored wood sample (core) was taken. The age was determined using standard dendrochronological methods. The data on the phytomass of 16 model pine trees and 12 larch trees were obtained with subdivision into the following fractions: phytomass of the trunk, branches, needles and generative organs. The trunk phytomass in the bark was determined by direct weighing in the field with an accuracy of 50 g, for which the trunk was cut into meter sections. The percentage of dry matter, both in the wood and in the bark, is determined by the discs cut from the ends of the sawn sections. Wood and bark from the discs were weighed with an accuracy of 0.1 g at the site, and then they were sent to the laboratory for further drying and determination of their weight in an absolutely dry state. When determining the phytomass of the crown and its structural parts, all branches from the trunk were chopped off. The total weight of the crown was determined by direct weighing at the site in the field, after which the crown was divided into parts covered with needles and without them, and they were weighed separately. A sample of up to 20\u201330% of the total weight was taken. The needles in the sample were separated from the branches and weighed. To determine the absolutely dry matter, a sample weighing 30-60 g was taken from each crown fraction for subsequent drying to an absolutely dry state in laboratory conditions. The assessment of the scale of changes in the area of treeless territories on the slopes of the Kraka mountain ranges was carried out using the functionality of the SAS.Planet 160707 program. Using the \u201ctools\u201d from the \u201cTags\u201d tab, on the basis of the images in the layers of modern (2015) satellite images of sub-meter resolution and maps (~ 1986) of the GosGisCentre (M 1: 25000), all non-forested areas were identified where the forest stands below 35-40%. For each treeless territory, its area was estimated in 1986 and 2016. Comparative characteristics of the habitat within the ecotone between closed forests and the mountain steppe and the patterns of changes in the morphometric parameters of tree stands at different altitude levels on the slopes of the South Kraka massif showed that the trunk diameter, height and age of trees increase from the lower to the upper level. At the upper level, single, old-growth, strongly intermittent trees are most often found. Down the slope, the number of trees at the middle level increases 15 times, and 40 times at the lower level. At the same time, the average age and diameter of trees decrease, while the height increases. In the North Kraka, the average values of the diameter, height and age, on the contrary, decrease from the lower to the upper level. Here the number and the average age of trees are significantly lower than in the South Kraka, especially at the upper levels (See Table 2). On the basis of the set of model trees of Scots pine and Sukachev larch, we studied the dependences of the aboveground phytomass and fractional structure (trunk, crown, needles) between different parameters of trees. We developed regression equations for the total aboveground phytomass of trees, as well as of the trunk, crown and needles from the diameter at the base and the height of the trunk (See Fig. 2 and 3; Table 4). On the basis of the equations, the reserves of aboveground phytomass were calculated for all altitudinal levels of the studied transects, and separately for the South and North Kraka mountains. The revealed features of the accumulation of phytomass of various fractions of trees and their ratio depend on the altitudinal position in the ecotone, the age and tree species. We found out that the total aboveground phytomass of stands at the upper border of closed forests on average for all profiles in the South Kraka is 72.9 ton /ha and ranges from 45.4 to 106 ton /ha. When moving to the upper border of open forests, it decreases 1.8 times and averages 40.1 ton / ha (37.7\u201342.4 ton / ha). Towards the border of sparse tree stands, the aboveground phytomass of stands is reduced by almost 16 times - to 4.4 ton/ ha (2.4\u20137.4 ton / ha). In the North Kraka mountain massif, the aboveground phytomass of stands at the border of closed forest and open woodlands is significantly higher than in the Southern Kraka, averaging 98.7 and 42.1 ton / ha, respectively, with a 2.3-time decrease in phytomass. In the sparse tree stands, on the contrary, the phytomass of stands is lower than in the South Kraka, averaging 1.69 ton / ha across all transects, which is almost 60 times less than at the third altitudinal level (Table 5). Analysis of climate change over the past 80 years showed that in the study area there was a 1.3\u00b0C increase in air temperature and an increase in precipitations by 41 mm, which are most pronounced during the cold season. Climate change had a favorable effect on the growth of woody plants, which led to an active overgrowth of mountain steppes with forests, as well as an increase in the density of woodlands. Over the past 30 years, there has been a decrease in the total area of treeless territories on the slopes of the mountains in the Kraka massif by more than 2 thousand hectares (17.6%). The overgrowth of mountain steppes with woody vegetation in the Kraka mountains led to an increase in the area of forests and the stock of phytomass concentrated in them equals to 92.3 thousand tons. This is equivalent to the long-term binding of appoximately 42.6 thousand tons of free carbon of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.

We first address confusion over terminology, including the descriptor noncognitive. We conclude that debate over the optimal name for this broad category of personal qualities obscures substantial agreement about the specific attributes worth measuring. Next, we discuss advantages and limitations of different measures. In particular, we compare self-report questionnaires, teacher-report questionnaires, and performance tasks, using self-control as an illustrative case study to make the general point that each approach is imperfect in its own way. Finally, we discuss how each measure\u2019s imperfections can affect its suitability for program evaluation, accountability, individual diagnosis, and practice improvement. For example, we do not believe any available measure is suitable for between-school accountability judgments. In addition to urging caution among policymakers and practitioners, we highlight medium-term innovations that may make measures of these personal qualities more suitable for educational purposes.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Literature and Literary Theory\", \"Linguistics and Language\", \"History\", \"Language and Linguistics\", \"Cultural Studies\"]", "language": "en", "length": [52, 0, 0], "string": "title={Review.

The length-to-depth ratio of the bay was L/D=8, the diameter of the missile was d1 =0.178 m, the diameter of the jet was d2 =0.05 m . The FLUENT software was combined with our group-developed code under the platform of a user-defined function (UDF) to solve the flow field and the six-degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) of missile. The detached eddy simulation method and dynamic mesh technology were used in the numerical calculations. The boundary condition of missile, bay, and aircraft was no-slip wall condition. The boundary condition of the jet was the pressure-inlet. The pressure far-field boundary was selected as other boundaries. The constraint of the ejection device on the missile was considered. It was found that the jet control device thickens the shear layer, so the shear layer with more gradual velocity gradients, which is beneficial to the separation of missile. The distance between the internal weapons bay and the missile in the positive z-direction with the jet is 1.74 times that without the jet at t=0.5 s. In the case of the jet control device, the pitching angle of the missile ranged from 0.93\u00b0 to -3.94\u00b0 , the angular motion range of the missile with the jet is smaller than that without. The jet can make the characteristics of the flow field friendly, and enable the missile to separate from the bay quickly, stably, and safely.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Genetics\", \"Molecular Biology\", \"Biochemistry\", \"Biotechnology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [87, 0, 0], "string": "title={Assessing the ABCG2 Protein Interactome: a Potential Strategy to Disrupt ABCG2 Function}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Applied Mathematics\", \"Modeling and Simulation\"]", "language": "en", "length": [129, 0, 1670], "string": "title={Two-dimensional finite element model to study the effect of water flux on the nitrate dynamics in the rhizosphere of a maize root}, container_title={}, abstract={The growth of plants and the quality and quantity of crop production depend on the uptake dynamics of water and mineral salts by the roots from the rhizosphere.

Quantification Based on Detailed Field Data on Animal Level with the Standardized Methodology of the European Medicines Agency in Veal Calves, Switzerland, 2016\u20132018}, container_title={}, abstract={Precise quantification of antimicrobial treatment incidence (TI) is crucial for benchmarking. Two widespread methods for treatment incidence quantification were compared for agreement. Field data were obtained from 38 veal farms from 2016 to 2018 (1905 calves, 1864 treatments). Calculation of TIswiss for calves was based on detailed treatment records using pharmacokinetic values from the Swiss Veterinary Medicines Compendium. The method published by the European Medicines Agency was used to calculate TI in defined daily doses (TIDDD). For each calf and treatment, TIswiss and TIDDD were calculated on level of the antimicrobial class, drug, application route, and farm. The quotient (Q) of TIswiss and TIDDD was calculated. Divergence in results between the two methods of \u226425% was arbitrarily set as good agreement. The agreement between TIswiss and TIDDD was mostly good. On class level, good agreement was observed for treatments representing 71.5% of the TIDDD, and 74.5% of the total TIDDD on drug level. Poor agreement was mainly observed for tylosin and sulfadimidine. The agreement was better for parenteral than for oral treatments (81.6% vs. 72.3%). For practically orientated calculation on farm level, good agreement was observed (77.5% of the TIDDD). The TIDDD method showed mostly good agreement, especially for parenteral treatments.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)\", \"Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology\"]", "language": "fr", "length": [67, 0, 893], "string": "title={Permeability tests in alluvial deposits and the determination of K0}, container_title={}, abstract={A brief description is given of the site at which an extensive programme of in situ constant head permeability tests has been carried out.

for an Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) with a separated buffer layer is presented in order to improve the trade-off between the turn-off loss (Eoff) and on-state voltage (Von). However, it is difficult to set efficient parameters due to the increase in the new buffer doping concentration variable. Therefore, a machine learning (ML) algorithm is proposed as a solution. Compared to the conventional Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) simulation tool, it is demonstrated that incorporating the ML algorithm into the device analysis could make it possible to achieve high accuracy and significantly shorten the simulation time. Specifically, utilizing the ML algorithm could achieve coefficients of determination (R2) of Von and Eoff of 0.995 and 0.968, respectively. In addition, it enables the optimized design to fit the target characteristics. In this study, the structure proposed for the trade-off improvement was targeted to obtain the minimum Eoff at the same Von, especially by adjusting the concentration of the separated buffer. We could improve Eoff by 36.2% by optimizing the structure, which was expected to be improved by 24.7% using the ML approach. In another way, it is possible to inversely design four types of structures with characteristics close to the target characteristics (Eoff = 1.64 \u03bcJ, Von = 1.38 V). The proposed method of incorporating machine learning into device analysis is expected to be very strategic, especially for power electronics analysis (where the transistor size is comparatively large and requires significant computation). In summary, we improved the trade-off using a separated buffer, and ML enabled optimization and a more precise design, as well as reverse engineering.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Aims: This study investigated the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS), which had already been validated in French and English versions. Method: In a large college student sample (N = 940), the factor analysis and regression analyses were performed on the IUS. Results: The IUS had excellent internal consistency (\u03b1 = 0.90) and good test-retest reliability (r = 0.75) over a 5-week period. Factor analysis showed that the IUS had a four-factor solution. Finally, the regression analysis demonstrated that IU contributed significantly to worry, after controlling for demographic variables and levels of anxiety and depression.

To clarify the impact of this stress on grapevine flower, we used the Vitis array based on Roche-NimbleGen technology to investigate the gene expression of flowers submitted to a cold night. Our objectives were to identify modifications in the transcript levels after stress and during recovery. Consequently, our results confirmed some mechanisms known in grapes or other plants in response to cold stress, notably, (1) the pivotal role of calcium/calmodulin-mediated signaling; (2) the over-expression of sugar transporters and some genes involved in plant defense (especially in carbon metabolism), and (3) the down-regulation of genes encoding galactinol synthase (GOLS), pectate lyases, or polygalacturonases. We also identified some mechanisms not yet known to be involved in the response to cold stress, i.e., (1) the up-regulation of genes encoding G-type lectin S-receptor-like serine threonine-protein kinase, pathogen recognition receptor (PRR5), or heat-shock factors among others; (2) the down-regulation of Myeloblastosis (MYB)-related transcription factors and the Constans-like zinc finger family; and (3) the down-regulation of some genes encoding Pathogen-Related (PR)-proteins. Taken together, our results revealed interesting features and potentially valuable traits associated with stress responses in the grapevine flower.

Subjects became proficient at performing sets of 10 pulses within boundaries of 8\u201312% MVC, with visual feedback and without (kinesthetic sense). In both the control (Con, n = 10) and experimental (Exp, n = 20) groups, subjects performed two sets of 10 kinesthetically guided pulses. Subjects then either performed a 10-s MVC (Exp) or remained at rest (Con) between sets. Following the MVC, Exp subjects had force errors of +30%, whereas performance was maintained in Con. There was evidence for both muscular and neural contributions to these errors. Postactivation potentiation resulted in a 40% gain in muscle contractility (p = .003), and there was a 26% increase in the neural stimulation of muscle (p = .014). Multiple regression indicated that the change in neural input had a stronger relationship with force errors than the increased contractility.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

MTHFR polymorphisms are related to several metabolic disorders and human cancers. We investigated the contribution of MTHFR 1298 and MTHFR 677 polymorphisms as potential risk factors for outcomes with HPV genotypes and STIs in Iranian population. Materials and Methods As a case\u2013control study, MTHFR A1298C and C677T were assessed for SNPs analysis using a PCR\u2013RFLP assay in 50 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) cases, 98 HPV-positive subjects and 47 non-cancerous/non-HPV patients as healthy controls. Results Finding suggested a significant association between the MTHFR 1298 CC polymorphisms (OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.13\u201310.82, P \u2264 0.05) in women with CIN as compared to non-cancerous/non-HPV subjects. There was not a significant difference of MTHFR 677 between outcomes. Discussion It would seem MTHFR 1298 CC is more likely to be a potential risk factor for HPV\u2013cervical cancer progression. Consequences support further attempts to understand the clinical manifestations of neoplasia related to genital infections and gene mutations.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

No. 004 Cardiovascular and metabolic effects of ovarian suppression as adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis}, container_title={Cardiovascular Research}, abstract={Abstract Background Adjuvant endocrine therapy is key treatment in early oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer (BC). In premenopausal BC ovarian function suppression (OFS) in combination with tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor (AI) is commonly used, particularly in high-risk patients who have received chemotherapy. The profound suppression of circulating oestradiol associated with OFS could have adverse cardiovascular and metabolic effects, We aim to evaluate the reported adverse effects within randomised phase III trials in premenopausal women with BC. Methods A systematic search of online databases was conducted to identify randomised control trials (RCTs) involving OFS which reported adverse events (hypertension, weight gain, thrombosis, cardiac ischemia, glucose intolerance and hyperglyacemia). Pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using a random-effects model. Results Four RCTs were included in the metanalysis with a total of 7808 patients, separated into 3 main treatment groups: Tamoxifen, OFS plus Tamoxifen and OFS plus AI. We found that OFS increased risk of hypertension when compared to Tamoxifen alone (7.6% vs. .4.8%, OR 1.49,95%CI 1.09\u20132.01; P = 0.01). Tamoxifen with OFS increased risk of thrombosis when compared to AI with OFS (1.7% vs. .0.7%, OR 2.87,95%CI 1.19\u20136.9; P = 0.02). Conclusions This highlights the possible impact of OFS in premenopausal women as it increases risk of developing hypertension which may require closer monitoring and initiation of early treatment. There appears to be a protective effect of AI when compared to Tamoxifen in terms of thrombosis. Further studies are needed to explore the impact of these drugs on the cardiovascular health of these young women with BC.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

The neural underpinnings of this deficit and its relationship to the symptoms of psychosis are still unclear.AimsTo examine the association between positive and negative psychotic symptoms and activation within the amygdala and extrastriate visual regions of patients with schizophrenia during fearful and neutral facial expression processing.MethodFunctional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure neural responses to neutral and fearful facial expressions in 11 patients with schizophrenia and 9 healthy volunteers during an implicit emotional task.ResultsNo association between amygdala activation and positive symptoms was found; the activation within the left superior temporal gyrus was negatively associated with the negative symptoms of the patients.ConclusionsOur results

on Expression of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa tolQRA Genes: Role of the Ferric Uptake Regulator}, container_title={}, abstract={ABSTRACT The tolQRA genes have been recently identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO. In this study, we examined the effect of iron and temperature on tolQRA expression. A promoterless lacZ gene was introduced downstream of plasmid-encoded tolQ and tolA , and expression was monitored by measuring \u03b2-galactosidase activity of cultures. Addition of 25 \u03bcM FeCl 3 to the culture medium reduced tolQRA expression by 50 to 60% in PAO but by only 25% in the fur mutant PAO A4. Northern hybridization analysis revealed that iron regulation occurs at the level of transcription and involves the P. aeruginosa ferric uptake regulator (Fur). Primer extension analysis was used to identify the proposed transcriptional start site of tolA . Although a putative Fur box was identified 20 bp upstream of the proposed start site, purified Fur did not bind to the tolA or tolQR promoter regions in an in vitro gel retardation assay. Therefore, iron regulation of the tol genes appears to involve an intermediate regulatory gene. Expression of tolQR and tolA was optimal at 37\u00b0C and was reduced by 40 to 50% when cultures were grown at either 42 or 25\u00b0C. Growth in high-iron medium at 25\u00b0C further reduced tolQR and tolA expression.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

M\u00e9todo: 30 participantes, 15 jovens jovens (JOV; 22,0\u00b13,7 anos) e 15 idosos (IDS; 69,8\u00b16,4 anos) caminharam em uma passarela com e sem carga adicional. A simula\u00e7\u00e3o do sobrepeso se deu atrav\u00e9s da adi\u00e7\u00e3o de carga em um colete de cargas vari\u00e1veis at\u00e9 alcan\u00e7ar o \u00edndice de massa corporal (IMC) de sobrepeso (JOV 25kg/m\u00b2; IDS 27kg/m). Os dados foram coletados atrav\u00e9s de uma plataforma de for\u00e7a (AMTI, OR6-7-2000). Resultados: A m\u00e9dia de carga adicionada foi de 13,2\u00b14,0 kg para JOV e 11,7\u00b13,4 para IDS; O n\u00edvel de signific\u00e2ncia foi de p\u22650,05. Ao normalizar os dados pelo peso, IDS obtiveram menores picos de FRS em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos JOV em ambas as velocidades. Por\u00e9m, o IDS foi maior que o JOV apenas no segundo pico da for\u00e7a vertical (Fz2) em velocidade r\u00e1pida. Conclus\u00f5es: O sobrepeso simulado de forma direta pode n\u00e3o ser capaz de promover mudan\u00e7as significativas nas quantidades de descarga do peso corporal que pudesse influenciar nas FRS.

However, the establishment of bovine-induced pluripotent stem cells (biPSCs) has been challenging. Here we report the generation of biPSCs from bovine mesenchymal stem cells (bMSCs) by overexpression of lysine-specific demethylase 4A (KDM4A) and the other reprogramming factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, cMYC, LIN28, and NANOG (KdOSKMLN). These biPSCs exhibited silenced transgene expression at passage 10, and had prolonged self-renewal capacity for over 70 passages. The biPSCs have flat, primed-like PSC colony morphology in combined media of knockout serum replacement (KSR) and mTeSR, but switched to dome-shaped, na\u00efve-like PSC colony morphology in mTeSR medium and 2i/LIF with single cell colonization capacity. These cells have comparable proliferation rate to the reported primed- or na\u00efve-state human PSCs, with three-germ layer differentiation capacity and normal karyotype. Transcriptome analysis revealed a high similarity of biPSCs to reported bovine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and embryos. The na\u00efve-like biPSCs can be incorporated into mouse embryos, with the extended capacity of integration into extra-embryonic tissues.

atherogenesis. The mechanism of atherosclerosis, which is specific to hemodialysis (HD) patients, was studied on the basis of SR gene expressions. Methods: The gene expressions of SR type A (SR-A) and CD36 were studied in peripheral monocytes by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Data were compared between HD (n = 30) and age-matched control subjects (n = 10). Serum levels of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to test its role in SR expression. The statistical differences and associations between two continuous variables were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test and Pearson's correlation coefficient, respectively. Results: The relative quantities of SR mRNAs were significantly greater in HD patients than in controls [median (interquartile range): SR-A, 1.67 (0.96-2.76) vs. 0.90 (0.60-1.04), p = 0.0060; CD36, 1.09 (0.88-1.74) vs. 0.74 (0.64-0.99), p = 0.0255]. The serum concentration of M-CSF was significantly higher in HD patients than in controls [1,121 (999-1,342) vs. 176 (155-202) pg/ml, p 2 = 0.1681, p = 0.0086) and that of CD36 mRNA (r2 = 0.1202, p = 0.0284) in all subjects (n = 40). Conclusion: HD patients are predisposed to atherosclerosis as a consequence of their enhanced monocyte SR expressions. SRs and M-CSF are potential therapeutic targets for atherosclerosis in this high-risk population.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

The purpose of this paper is to contribute to a growing body of research literature that examines how coaching techniques help school principals improve their instructional leadership. Design/methodology/approach Using a protocol based on a theories of practice framework (Argyris and Sch\u00f6n, 1974) to support principals in deepening their self-reflection, this study added the element of a guided peer-coaching component in a group setting. Findings Results confirmed the effectiveness of the coaching protocol for assisting principals in deepening their self-awareness and critical reflection regarding their leadership, including the way principals\u2019 core assumptions about teaching and leadership shaped the outcomes of their problem-solving strategies. Perceptions of the peer-coaching element were mixed, however. While principals reported feeling affirmed by sharing their leadership challenges with others, and indicated that the group coaching experience contributed to their sense of professional community, there were limitations to principals\u2019 willingness to challenge one another\u2019s core assumptions. Originality/value This study builds on literature that cites theories of practice as a mechanism for enhancing professional effectiveness and represents a further iteration of recent research studies applying the concept to the work of school principals. Findings affirm that a coaching protocol based on theories of practice is well received by principals, serves to deepen self-reflection, and can, in limited cases, contribute to sweeping changes of thinking and practice congruent with the concept of double-loop learning.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cancer Research\", \"Oncology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [67, 0, 738], "string": "title={Anal melanoma: A comparative comprehensive genomic profiling study.}, container_title={}, abstract={551 Background: Anal melanomas (AM) share histologic features with cutaneous melanomas (CM), are highly aggressive and behave in a distinct clinicopathologic pattern.

Ultrafiltration and hemodialysis lead to profound hemodynamic changes. The aim of this pilot study was to describe brain and hand oxygenation values in ESRD patients and their changes during hemodialysis.MethodsTwenty-seven patients treated by chronic hemodialysis and 17 controls patients of the same age were included in the study. Regional saturation of oxygen (SrO2) was measured at the brain frontal lobe and at the hand with dialysis access using the INVOS 5100C. In 17 of ESRD patients, SrO2was also monitored throughout hemodialysis. Finger systolic blood pressure and basic hemodialysis and laboratory data were collected.ResultsDialysis patients had lower brain and also hand SrO2values at rest (51.5 \u00b1 10.9 vs. 68 \u00b1 7%, p2to 47 \u00b1 8%, p2decrease was related to the ultrafiltration rate, the hand SrO2decrease to the finger pressure and to blood hemoglobin.ConclusionsChronic dialysis patients suffer from tissue ischemia and that even worsens after the beginning of hemodialysis.

We examined the biocatalyzed reactions towards 4-n-alkylcatechols with different side chains length, which is a factor important for the biological activities of catechols. 4-n-Alkylcatechols with methyl through heptyl side chains (1b\u20137b) were obtained in one pot by (i) oxidation of phenols 1a\u20137a with tyrosinase from Agaricus bisporus followed by (ii) reduction of ortho-quinones (intermediates) with L-ascorbic acid sodium salt. The conversions decreased with increasing side chain length. The preparative reactions were carried out with substrates 1a\u20135a. The isolated yields of the purified products decreased from 59% in 2b to 10% in 5b in correlation with logP of the substrates. Homology modeling indicated that the affinities of two tyrosinase isoforms (PPO3 and PPO4) to the substrates with side chains longer than C2 decreased with increasing side chain length.

As a novel representation of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, MXene has nice features with a strong negative charge and excellent hydrophilicity. Our previous research showed that MXene nanosheets were added in the aqueous phase, which enhanced the permeselectivity of the membrane and achieved persistent desalination performance. Embedding the nanomaterials into the polyamide layer through the organic phase can locate the nanomaterials on the upper surface of the polyamide layer, and also prevent the water layer around the hydrophilic nanomaterials from hindering the interfacial polymerization reaction. We supposed that if MXene nanosheets were added in the organic phase, MXene nanosheets would have more negative contact sites on the membrane surface and the crosslinking degree would increase. In this study, MXene were dispersed in the organic phase with the help of ultrasound, then MXene nanocomposite nanofiltration membranes were achieved. The prepared MXene membranes obtained enhanced negative charge and lower effective pore size. In the 28-day persistent desalination test, the Na2SO4 rejection of MXene membrane could reach 98.6%, which showed higher rejection compared with MXene embedded in aqueous phase. The results of a long-time water immersion test showed that MXene membrane could still maintain a high salt rejection after being soaked in water for up to 105 days, which indicated MXene on the membrane surface was stable. Besides MXene membrane showed high rejection for high-concentration brine and good mono/divalent salt separation performance in mono/divalent mixed salt solutions.

These vast datasets have revealed rare genotype anomalies that encourage further exploration of color and pattern inheritance. We previously reported the simultaneous presence of greater than two allele variants at the Agouti Signaling Protein (ASIP) locus in a commercial genotype cohort of 11,790 canids. Here we present additional data to characterize the occurrence of anomalous ASIP genotypes. We document the detection of combinations of three or four ASIP allele variants in 17 dog breeds and Dingoes, at within-breed frequencies of 1.32\u201363.34%. We analyze the potential impact on phenotype that these allele combinations present, and propose mechanisms that could account for the findings, including: gene recombination, duplication, and incorrect causal variant identification.

Evidence to guide decision-making, national guidelines and clinical pathways for many conditions in pediatric orthopedic surgery are limited. This study investigated decision-making rationale and quantified the evidence supporting decisions made by pediatric orthopedic surgeons in an outpatient clinic. Design/Setting/Participants/Intervention(s)/Main Outcome Measure(s) We recorded decisions made by eight pediatric orthopedic surgeons in an outpatient clinic and the surgeon\u2019s reported rationale behind the decisions. Surgeons categorized the rationale for each decision as one or a combination of 12 possibilities (e.g. \u2018Experience/anecdote,\u2019 \u2018First principles,\u2019 \u2018Trained to do it,\u2019 \u2018Arbitrary/instinct,\u2019 \u2018General study,\u2019 \u2018Specific study\u2019). Results Out of 1150 total decisions, the most frequent decisions were follow-up scheduling, followed by bracing prescription/removal. The most common decision rationales were \u2018First principles\u2019 (n = 310, 27.0%) and \u2018Experience/anecdote\u2019 (n = 253, 22.0%). Only 17.8% of decisions were attributed to scientific studies, with 7.3% based on studies specific to the decision. As high as 34.6% of surgical intervention decisions were based on scientific studies, while only 10.4% of follow-up scheduling decisions were made with studies in mind. Decision category was significantly associated with a basis in scientific studies: surgical intervention and medication prescription decisions were more likely to be based on scientific studies than all other decisions. Conclusions With increasing emphasis on high value, evidence-based care, understanding the rationale behind physician decision-making can educate physicians, identify common decisions without supporting evidence and help create clinical care pathways in pediatric orthopedic surgery. Decisions based on evidence or consensus between surgeons can inform pathways and national guidelines that minimize unwarranted variation in care and waste. Decision support tools and aids could also be implemented to guide these decisions.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

mediast\u00ednico, patolog\u00eda de baja incidencia y poco conocida, siendo a\u00fan m\u00e1s infrecuente en mediastino, sin haber reportes descritos en nuestro pa\u00eds.Casos Cl\u00ednicos: 2 pacientes, ambos de sexo masculino, menores de 3 a\u00f1os, en los que se encontr\u00f3 como hallazgo incidental una masa mediast\u00ednica en una radiograf\u00eda de t\u00f3rax. El estudio se complement\u00f3 con una tomograf\u00eda computada y en uno de los pacientes con una biopsia toracosc\u00f3pica. En ambos se logr\u00f3 extirpaci\u00f3n completa de la lesi\u00f3n v\u00eda toracotom\u00eda, siendo apoyado v\u00eda toracosc\u00f3pica previa a la extracci\u00f3n de la lesi\u00f3n en uno de ellos.

to 15% of all acute strokes occur while patients are in the hospital, and given their association with other acute conditions, recognition and treatment can be complex. We sought to determine the effectiveness of our nurse-led Stroke Team management of in-hospital stroke within a community hospital setting. Methods: In 2011, our nurse-led Stroke Team was designated as the primary responders for all in-hospital Stroke Alerts. Along with an \u201cIn Hospital Stroke Alert Protocol\u201d designed to eliminate barriers and penalties associated with any staff member\u2019s notification of a Stroke Alert, the nurse-led Stroke Team assumed responsibility for hospital-wide education on stroke identification and response, including provision of feedback sessions following the occurrence of a stroke on any inpatient unit. Results: In the 24 months prior to the launch of the new system, two in-hospital stroke patients were treated with intravenous tPA. In 2010, there was 1 intravenous tPA given at 120 minutes, and in 2011 there was 1 intravenous tPA given at 84 minutes. For the first 6 months of 2012 there have been 3 patients treated with intravenous tPA as in-hospital stroke alerts, given at 58, 62 and 38 minutes from time of call respectively. There were no sICH or systemic hemorrhages for any patients. Staff have voiced considerable satisfaction with the process, and no barriers to use of the team have been identified. Conclusion: Nurse-led Stroke Team responders are capable of managing the appropriate and safe use of intravenous tPA treatment for in-hospital stroke patients, while engaging diverse groups of providers in the rapid identification of acute stroke events. Community hospitals should consider development of nurse-led Stroke Teams to complement existing rapid response team efforts.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Physiology (medical)\", \"Pathology and Forensic Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [69, 0, 0], "string": "title={Endogenous sodium pump inhibitors, diabetes mellitus and preeclampsia}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment\"]", "language": "en", "length": [102, 0, 0], "string": "title={Understanding Triplet Formation Pathways in Bulk Heterojunction Polymer:Fullerene Photovoltaic Devices}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Literature and Literary Theory\", \"Archeology\", \"Visual Arts and Performing Arts\", \"History\", \"Archeology\", \"Classics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [192, 0, 0], "string": "title={R.

The article's suggestion is that the notion of a social practice, as used by MacIntyre (1985) and others is helpful in framing thinking about research ethics in planning because it places the individual's acquisition and development of a moral perception, and judgements, within a social context.

abstract={Climate-driven variations in lake-groundwater exchange are recorded by sediments in groundwater-dominated lakes. A groundwater flow-through lake in west-central Montana (USA) registers latest Pleistocene and Holocene hydroclimatic variation in fluid and solute balance, as controlled by rates and timing of groundwater recharge. Early Holocene warming occurred under conditions of relative aridity and low groundwater throughflow, punctuated by a c. 450-yr episode of lake dilution centered on 11 000 cal. yr BP. Maximum evaporative concentration of lake waters, registered in both \u03b418O values and mineralogy of endogenic carbonates, coincided with the early-Holocene peak in insolation seasonality at about 9750 cal. yr BP. Subsequently, progressively decreasing lake residence time drove a sustained long-term decline in salinity while having a very subdued effect on mean \u03b418O values. We explain this decoupling by (1) limits placed on oxygen isotope sensitivity by groundwater throughflow, and (2) a shift toward greater summer rain contribution to lake inflow after mid-Holocene time. Superimposed multidecadal- and century-scale variation in lake\u2014groundwater exchange generated high-frequency but low-amplitude isotopic oscillations throughout the record. High rates of groundwater throughflow maintaining low lake salinity similar to that observed today were established around 1400 cal. yr BP. We infer reduced regional stream baseflow, decrease in permanent wetlands (relative increase in ephemeral wetlands) and enhanced lake and wetland salinity prior to this time, relative to the late Holocene.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cancer Research\", \"Genetics\", \"Oncology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [105, 0, 1346], "string": "title={LncRNA GACAT3 promotes esophageal squamous cell carcinoma progression through regulation of miR-149/FOXM1}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Background The long noncoding RNA gastric cancer associated transcript 3 (GACAT3) has been demonstrated to be implicated in the carcinogenesis and progression of many malignancies. However, GACAT3\u2019s levels and role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has not been elucidated. Methods GACAT3 amounts were investigated in ESCC tissues and cell lines by qPCR. Its biological functions were examined by CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, wound healing assay, transwell assay, and xenograft model establishment. The relationship between GACAT3 and miR-149 was assessed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Results GACAT3 amounts were elevated in ESCC tissue and cell specimens. Functional studies showed that GACAT3 silencing reduced the proliferation, migration and invasion of cultured ESCC cells, and decreased tumor growth in mice. Furthermore, GACAT could directly interact with miR-149. In addition, colony formation and invasion assays verified that GACAT3 promotes ESCC tumor progression through miR-149. Moreover, GACAT3 acted as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to modulate FOXM1 expression. Conclusions These findings indicate that GACAT3 functions as an oncogene by acting as a ceRNA for miR-149 to modulate FOXM1 expression in ESCC, suggesting that GACAT3 might constitute a therapeutic

The effect of varying T1 relaxivities of gadolinium-based contrast agents on facial nerve enhancement is unclear. In this study, we assess differences in normal facial nerve enhancement with two different gadolinium-based contrast agents, gadobutrol and gadopentetate dimeglumine. In addition, we evaluate differences in facial nerve enhancement with spin-echo (SE) T1 versus 3D inversion recovery prepared fast spoiled gradient-echo (FSPGR) post-contrast sequences. Methods A total of 140 facial nerves in 70 individuals were evaluated (70 with gadobutrol and 70 with gadopentetate dimeglumine) by two blinded reviewers. Differences in enhancement of facial nerve segments between the two agents were analyzed. Differences in enhancement between SE T1 and FSPGR imaging were also evaluated. Results There was no significant difference in facial nerve enhancement between gadobutrol and gadopentetate dimeglumine. Enhancement was commonly observed in the geniculate, tympanic and mastoid segments (98%\u2013100%) with either contrast agent; enhancement was less common in the labyrinthine segments (9%\u201314%) and lateral canalicular segment (2%\u20135%). There was a smaller enhancing proportion of labyrinthine and tympanic segments with FSPGR as compared to SE T1 images with gadobutrol. Conclusion There is no significant difference in overall enhancement of the facial nerve between gadobutrol and gadopentetate dimeglumine. Mild enhancement of the lateral canalicular portion of the facial nerve may be a normal finding. With FSPGR sequence, there is lesser perceived enhancement of the labyrinthine and tympanic segments of the facial nerve with gadobutrol.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Sociology and Political Science\", \"History\", \"Anthropology\", \"Cultural Studies\"]", "language": "en", "length": [209, 12, 0], "string": "title={Screening Religions in Italy: Contemporary Italian Cinema and Television in the Post-Secular Public Sphere, by Clodagh J.

Ampicillin and cloxacillin produce a 50% inhibition of the globinolytic activity of plasmin at 4.5 and 5.3 mM respectively. A lower inhibitory capacity is displayed by carbenicillin. Assay of plasmin by its amidolytic activity on D-valyl-L-leucyl-L-lysine p-nitroanilide dihydrochloride showed that ampicillin at a concentration producing half-maximal inhibition converted the hyperbolic activity-substrate concentration curve into a sigmoidal curve. A similar conversion occurred in the presence of ampicillin when plasmin was assayed with an alternative chromogenic substrate, L-pyroglutamyl-glycyl-L-arginine p-nitroanilide hydrochloride 6-Aminohexanoic acid at 7.5 microM abolished the inhibition of plasmin induced by ampicillin. The present observations suggest that ampicillin interacts with plasmin at a regulatory site different from the active site of the enzyme. The effect of 6-aminohexanoic acid indicates that the lysine-binding site may be part of a regulatory site.

In this paper I will examine how Gage\u2019s insufficiently studied narrative influenced Cromwell\u2019s military project, and will also focus on how this and similar writing produced a number of precarious and self-cancelling identities from which he tried to profit.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health\"]", "language": "en", "length": [50, 0, 0], "string": "title={Oral and Dental Aspects in Child Abuse and Neglect}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Insect Science\", \"Agronomy and Crop Science\", \"Ecology\", \"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [73, 0, 0], "string": "title={Integrated pest management in tea: recent advances and future challenges#}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Stratigraphy\", \"Geology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [135, 13, 0], "string": "title={Evidence for carbonate platform failure during rapid sea-level rise;

However, these positive properties can be fully realised only if the fibres are uniformly distributed. Otherwise, that leads to different quality of the concrete and to deterioration of strength characteristics. The subject of this article is the segregation of steel fibres which is one of the frequent problems of poor distribution of fibres. The degree of segregation has been investigated depending on amount of fibre dosage, size of maximum aggregate size and degree of consistency of fresh concrete. Two types of steel fibres with circular cross-section of a diameter of 0.4 mm but with different lengths (12.5 and 25 mm) were used for experiments. The segregation was evaluated by the drop of the fibres on the cutting surface of specimens. The results showed that segregation was the most affected by the consistency of fresh concrete.

Accordingly, adaptation to climate change has shifted towards the centre of attention in both policy and research. In this article, we review the last 10 years of adaptation research (2008\u20132018), with a focus on work within the Earth System Governance network. We use the lens of access and allocation to structure our review and examine how adaptation affects, and is affected by, access to basic needs, basic rights, and decision-making on the one hand, as well as allocation of responsibilities, resources, and risks on the other. We find that questions of justice, equity, and fairness are fundamental to all dimensions of adaptation. The access perspective, for example, suggests that we need to assess vulnerability, understood broadly, while the allocation perspective focuses on questions of responsibility for being vulnerable, e.g. when people live, or move to, hazard-prone areas exposed to climate risk. This also relates to questions of who is responsible for selecting, implementing, and funding adaptation measures. Overall, we find that the framework of \u201caccess and allocation\u201d and its subcategories offer a detailed approach to adaptation and adaptation research, but that it is not intuitive.

container_title={}, abstract={Aortic aneurism open repair surgery can cause spinal cord (SC) injury with 5\u201315% of patients developing paraparesis or paraplegia. Using a mouse model of transient aortic cross-clamping (ACC), we have previously found that the expression of proinflammatory microRNA miR-155 increases in motoneurons (MNs) and endothelial cells (ECs) of ischemic SCs, and that global miR-155 deletion decreases the percentage of paraplegia by 37.4% at 48-h post-ACC. Here, we investigated the cell-specific contribution of miR-155 in choline acetyltransferase-positive (ChAT+) neurons (that include all MNs of the SC) and ECs to SC injury after ACC. Mice lacking miR-155 in ChAT+ neurons (MN-miR-155-KO mice) developed 24.6% less paraplegia than control mice at 48-h post-ACC. In contrast, mice lacking miR-155 in ECs (ECs-miR-155-KO mice) experienced the same percentage of paraplegia as control mice, despite presenting smaller central cord edema. Unexpectedly, mice overexpressing miR-155 in ChAT+ neurons were less likely than control mice to develop early paraplegia during the first day post-ACC, however they reached the same percentage of paraplegia at 48-h. In addition, all mice overexpressing miR-155 in ECs (ECs-miR-155-KI mice) were paraplegic at 48-h post-ACC. Altogether, our results suggest that miR-155 activity in ChAT+ neurons protects the SC against ischemic injury during the first day post-ACC before becoming deleterious during the second day, which indicates that early and late paraplegias arise from different molecular malfunctions. These results point to the need to develop specific protective therapeutics aimed at inhibiting both the early and late deleterious events after open repair surgery of aortic aneurisms.}",

The completion time (makespan) of disassembling EOL products is highly associated with the allocation of operators, especially in parallel disassembly. In this paper, asynchronous parallel disassembly planning (APDP), which avoids the necessity to synchronize disassembly tasks of manipulators during the parallel disassembly process, is studied to optimize the task assignment of manipulators for minimal makespan. We utilize four mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations to identify the optimal solutions. A set of different-sized instances are used to test and compare the performance of the proposed models, including some real-world cases. Finally, the proposed exact algorithm is further compared with the existing approach to solving APDP. Results indicate that a significant difference exists in terms of the computational efficiency of the MILP models, while three of four MILP formulations can efficiently achieve better solutions than that of the existing approach.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

The main features of its poetics as a transitional phenomenon between avant-garde and postmodernism are revealed: meditativeness, uncertainty, blurring of the composition, variability of the rhythmic structure, intertextuality, polystylistic, reflexivity, self-absorption, etc. It is concluded that Silvestrov went through a complex evolution from avant-garde experiments to quiet simplicity, to small vocal form and poetics of introspection. He created a sound model of the world, immersed in contemplation and reflection, understood as the path of self-awareness, tragic and beautiful at the same time.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cell Biology\", \"Aging\"]", "language": "en", "length": [0, 0, 0], "string": "title={}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Law\", \"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law\", \"Economics and Econometrics\", \"Aquatic Science\"]", "language": "en", "length": [102, 0, 0], "string": "title={Barriers to wildlife movement in straits: Problematizing habitat connectivity across marine ecosystems}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Education\"]", "language": "es", "length": [72, 0, 810], "string": "title={\u201cMi escuela es como\u2026\u201d an\u00e1lisis de met\u00e1foras del profesorado principiante}, container_title={}, abstract={RESUMEN En este art\u00edculo analizamos las concepciones que docentes principiantes de un programa de inducci\u00f3n tienen sobre la escuela.

Through the evaluation of tourists\u2019 environmental behavior perception, the relationship between spatial characteristics and tourists\u2019 perception is fully considered, which plays an important role in the protection and development of public space in historical and cultural blocks. This paper takes the historical and cultural block of Sanhe Ancient Town in Hefei as the research area, focusing on the public space of the block. Through the analysis of the semantic differential method and eye movement legal quantitative analysis, from the angle of psychological perception and visual perception, we carried out an analysis of the historical and cultural block\u2019s public space, and built the double sense of a comprehensive evaluation system of parsing the historical and cultural blocks with the whole situation of public space and the rule of the performance. The results show that: (1) the visual perception preference for spatial elements is in the order of architectural structure > green landscape > architectural decoration > commercial activities > participants > pavement > street furniture > others. (2) There is a significant correlation but not a complete convergence of psychological perception and visual perception. (3) Buildings, structures, and space formats play a key role in creating a sense of space scale, with the former playing a positive role and the latter a negative role. (4) The visual attraction of a green landscape is strong and can improve the visual quality of space. The research found that there are evaluation differences between the visual perception and psychological perception of spatial elements, which are significantly correlated but not fully convergent. Through quantitative analysis and the interpretation of tourists\u2019 perception from different perspectives, we can take relevant improvement and optimization measures for many deficiencies of

Medicine first offered the elective Student Shelter Opportunities I (SSOI) course in 2016 to provide pre-clinical students with an opportunity to engage with shelter medicine and high-quality, high-volume surgery (HQHVS) concepts. The course utilized online asynchronous coursework to deliver content that was completed on a self-guided timeline by students. With most of the veterinary medical curriculum delivered in a traditional classroom format, it is important to assess learning in this unique course format. There is also limited information on educational experiences in online shelter medicine coursework. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate student learning in the asynchronous online portion of the SSOI elective course using paired pre- and post-test scores from a multiple-choice type assessment. The study investigated how students\u2019 pre-test and post-test scores compared and whether time to completion of material influenced student assessment performance. Paired assessments from 400 students were analyzed, and a statistically significant increase was found in post-test scores compared to pre-test following completion of the online coursework ( p}",

informativity of phraseological units in the Old Church Slavonic language in the aspect of the history of Russian phraseological system. The author pays her attention to the superword language units in Slavonic manuscripts of the 10-11th centuries. The purpose of the research is to identify through the prism of phraseology the origins of Slavonic key values, which were transformed during Christianization, and their superword nominations. The novelty of the study lies in the fact that besides the canon sources, the article analyzes the sources which were ignored by the authors of the Old Church Slavonic dictionaries. The object of the research is the Old Church Slavonic phraseological units reconstructed with the continuous sampling method from the texts created in different parts of medieval Slavia. To analyze the linguistic material, comparative-historical, linguoculturological, linguocognitive methods and methods of component and contextual analysis were used. As a result, adjustments were made to the idea of the activities of medieval Christian communities. Old Slavonic phraseological units testify that the former pagan Russians were attracted to Christians by their boundless faith in the truth of Christ\u2019s teaching, their ability to defend their beliefs, personal courage, love for neighbor and mercy. The relevance of this study is that in the context of globalization, the Christian values assimilated by the Eastern Slavs during Christianization, which contributed to the powerful take off of Russian culture, today need to be protected. The research direction outlined in this article opens up the prospects of establishing the origins of the Russian Christian phraseological corpus and its rules.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0,

abstract={Areal mapping of the middle Wisconsin varved clay site along Sixmile Creek near Ithaca, New York, has revealed a much more widespread and varied array of sediments than previously thought. Lacustrine clays, some varved, are interbedded with sands and gravels interpreted as sub-aqueous fan deposits, and both are overlain by a deformation till. Nine radiocarbon dates indicate a 34\u201337 14C ka BP age for the lacustrine sediment, with the deformation till less than a few thousand years younger. Beneath this sequence is a deposit dated at \u00b1 42 14C ka BP. Both strata represent a tundra climate with a mean July temperature of about 10\u00b0C. The Sixmile Creek deformation till must correlate with the 35 14C ka BP till along the Genesee River, 125 km to the NW, and defines a Cherrytree stade glacial advance into the Appalachian Plateau, much further south than what has generally been accepted. Such an advance would require drainage from a proglacial lake in the western Ontario basin to flow westward instead of northeastward. The Sixmile strata suggest a colder than accepted middle Wisconsin stage.

Measurable Myeloma-Specific Immunity in the Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (SCT) Setting}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Abstract 997 Adoptive T cell therapy requires the infusion of highly tumor specific T cells capable of trafficking to the tumor site, killing the tumor and persisting over time. MILs (as compared to peripheral blood T cells) possess many of these features (Noonan, Ca, Res. 2006). We here report the initial results from our Phase I/II trial. 22 patients were transplanted with a Melphalan-200. 19 with a CD34-selected product, 1 unselected autologous stem cells and 2 auto-BMT. 12 underwent SCT as initial consolidation and 10 patients with relapsed disease that were heavily pre-treated with an average of 3.2 prior therapies. Mean ISS score was 2.0. Average age was 56 (29\u201371). MILs were expanded with anti-CD3/CD28 beads for 7 days (avg. fold expansion 48.5 and avg. cell dose 2.8\u00d710e7 CD3/kg). MILs were infused on day +3. Patients in a CR were ineligible for this study. The best clinical response included 6CRs (27%), 10PRs (45%). Autologous GVHD which was observed in 32% of patients, was limited to the skin and required no treatment. Development of this syndome did not correlate with improved clinical outcomes. Lymphoid recovery was rapid with a mean absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) on day 15 of 886 cells/ul. The laboratory immune monitoring studies were only performed in the bone marrow \u2013 the disease site and not in the peripheral blood. The percent CD3+ T cells in the BM was 13% at baseline with a CD4:CD8 ratio of 1:3. By day 60, BM T cell reconstitution was complete and showed an inversion of the CD4:8 ratio of 0.39 that persisted through day 360. At baseline, there were more CD4 effector memory (CD4EM) (CD62L\u2212/CD45RO+) than CD4 central memory (CD4CM) (CD62L+/CD45RO+) (43% vs 27%). The CD4CM population peaked on day 60 at 43% and persisted through 1 year, CD4EM remained unchanged, and the CD4Effector decreased from 19.8% to 5.6%. The CD8 subpopulations remained unchanged from pre-SCT to 1 year post-SCT. Treg numbers doubled from harvest to post-SCT consistent with previous studies showing a greater number of Tregs in healthy BM compared to MM-BM. Activated T cells (CD69+) doubled from pre- to post-SCT. IFN\u03b3 production in both CD4 and CD8 cells more than doubled compared to pre-SCT and was maintained at 1 year suggesting the persistence of the infused MILs. The immune monitoring in the BM based on clinical responses revealed that patients achieving a CR/PR showed greater CD8 numbers at day +60 compared to stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD)(14.5% vs. 7.6%, respectively) and inversion of the CD4/CD8 ratio at 1 year (0.55 vs 1.26). In patients with SD or PD, the immune infiltrate in the BM was characterized by a large numbers of effector and effector-memory T cells and few CD8CM at baseline. CR patients possessed the fewest CD8Effector and the most CD8CM with persistence of CD8CM out to one year. These patients also showed a greater expansion in IFN\u03b3 cells as well as a greater amount of IFN\u03b3 production at each time point. Importantly, tumor-specific IFN\u03b3 production of CD3 cells in the BM was predictive of a clinical response. Patients achieving a CR showed twice the antigen-specific IFN\u03b3 production compared to all other groups at day 180 which persisted through 1 year. Analyses of additional immune subsets will be discussed in greater detail. This is the first reported trial utilizing activated MILs as a source of tumor specific T cells. We have demonstrated the ability to effectively expand MILs ex vivo and provide an analysis of the parameters of immune reconstitution demonstrating that the clinical outcome correlated with the robustness of the immune response in the BM.

at Bothkennar in Scotland, work has been carried out to provide data characterizing the clay for the benefit of future research projects. State of the art methods were used to enhance the research value of the characterization project. Fieldwork in 1989 involved high quality sampling using equipment from Laval and Sherbrooke Universities in Canada, and a 100 mm fixed piston sampler operated by the Building Research Establishment. In situ testing to augment earlier work at the site included in situ permeability, hydraulic fracture and field vane tests. Laboratory testing was undertaken by seven institutions in the UK and by Laval University. It involved the measurement of permeability and its variation with void ratio and flow direction, the measurement of yield and compressibility characteristics in oedometer tests, the measurement of stress-strain-strength and yield characteristics using triaxial and simple shear tests and the investigation of progressive destructuring of the clay using triaxial strain path tests. Using the results from this and earlier work, the Paper gives an overview of the ground conditions and the behaviour of the clay. The study also yielded information on the techniques of sampling and testing appropriate to soft naturally structured soils.

Ballantyne\u2019s novel The Cunninghams (1948) was deemed upon publication to be a \u201cmasterly study of working-class family life in a New Zealand town\u201d and it was praised for its \u201cutmost fidelity\u201d to the \u201cminutiae of small-town life\u201d. The novel\u2019s grim tone, Depression-era setting, local referent and critical realism did much to establish Ballantyne as an author with \u201csocial interests\u201d, as did his own assertion that a writer is \u201can investigator of human existence\u201d who \u201cmust try to understand the way in which average people live out their time\u201d. Ballantyne was one of several new writers deemed to be the \u201csons\u201d of Frank Sargeson, capable of developing the line of realism established by the latter\u2019s short stories that appeared between 1935 and 1945. Yet, in spite of his early promise, Ballantyne\u2019s career as a fiction writer failed to take off, partly because of a long period of alcoholism, and partly because of the direction he took in his subsequent fiction. If his first novel answered literary nationalism\u2019s need for an authentic depiction of local life, then Sydney Bridge Upside Down (1968), with its gestures towards the non-realist modes of fairy tale and gothic, was almost guaranteed to remain outside the body of writing understood to constitute \u201cNew Zealand literature\u201d. Yet, by combining aspects of realist with non-realist modes, the novel creates a mythologized version of New Zealand society in which threats associated with sexuality take on nightmarish, almost elemental forms that are far more effective in terms of representing the ways in which New Zealand society can damage the individual than social realism.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Visual Arts and Performing Arts\"]", "language": "en", "length": [53, 21, 943], "string": "title={Jarry's Caesar Antichrist and the Theatre of the Book}, container_title={New Theatre Quarterly}, abstract={The familiarity bred by the notoriety in its own times of Alfred Jarry's Ubu Roi has been accompanied by neglect for his other work, especially that which seems of peripheral interest to the theatre practitioner.

Upon activation by cytokines, the catalytic subunits of the proteasome are replaced by distinct isoforms resulting in the formation of an immunoproteasome (iProteasome). iProteasome generates peptides used by major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) for antigen presentation and is essential for immune responses. HIV-1 is the causative agent of AIDS, and HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) provide immune responses limiting viral replication. This study identifies a distinct mechanism by which HIV-1 promotes immune evasion. The viral protein negative regulatory factor (Nef) interacts with a component of iProteasome, LMP7, attenuating iProteasome formation and protein degradation function, and thus repressing the MHC-I antigen presentation activity of MHC-I.

(designated B00001T and B00002T) were isolated from forest soil samples collected from Yakushima Island, Kagoshima, Japan. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strains B00001T and B00002T respectively formed independent branches within the suborders Cystobacterineae and Sorangiineae and were most closely related to Cystobacter armeniaca DSM 14710T (90.4 % similarity) and Byssovorax cruenta DSM 14553T (91.3 %). Neither strain showed typical features of myxobacteria such as bacteriolytic action or fruiting body formation, but both had high DNA G+C contents (66.3\u201368.3 mol%). Swarming motility was observed in strain B00002T only. Cells of both strains were vegetative, chemoheterotrophic, mesophilic, strictly aerobic, Gram-negative, motile rods, and both strains exhibited esterase lipase (C8), leucine arylamidase, naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase and \u03b2-galactosidase activities. Strain B00001T contained MK-7 as the predominant respiratory quinone and the major fatty acid was iso-C15 : 0. In contrast, strain B00002T contained MK-8 as the major cellular quinone and the major fatty acids were C16 : 1\u03c95c and iso-C17 : 0. Based on the phenotypic and genotypic data presented, strains B00001T and B00002T represent novel genera and species, for which we propose the names Vulgatibacter incomptus gen. nov., sp. nov. and Labilithrix luteola gen. nov., sp. nov., respectively. The type strains of Vulgatibacter incomptus and Labilithrix luteola are B00001T ( = NBRC 109945T = DSM 27710T) and B00002T ( = NBRC 109946T = DSM 27648T), respectively. The new genera are assigned to the new families Vulgatibacteraceae fam. nov. and Labilitrichaceae fam. nov., respectively. In addition, Anaeromyxobacteraceae fam. nov., is proposed to accommodate the genus Anaeromyxobacter , which is related to the genus Vulgatibacter.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0,

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of peripheral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment of idiopathic facial paralysis, to explore an ideal treatment scheme for idiopathic facial paralysis, and to provide evidence for clinical rehabilitation. Methods. 65 patients with idiopathic facial nerve palsy with the first onset were recruited and randomly divided into rTMS group and control group. Both groups received conventional treatment, rTMS group received additional repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to the affected side once a day, 5 times a week for 2 weeks. House-Brackmann (HB) grading scale, Sunnybrook facial grading system (SFGS), and modified Portmann scale (MPS) were used to assess facial nerve function before and after treatment, and the time for patients to return to normal facial nerve function and adverse reaction (AR) was also the main observation index. Results. After a 2-week intervention, HB, SFGS, and MPS increased in both groups ( P 0.01 ); the improvement of HB, SFGS, and MPS in rTMS group was significantly higher than that in control group ( P 0.01 ). The effective improvement rate of the TMS group after 2 weeks was 90.0%, and that of the control group was 53.3%, and the difference was statistically significant ( P 0.01 ). Conclusions. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is a safe and effective noninvasive method for the treatment of idiopathic facial paralysis, which can significantly accelerate the recovery of facial nerve function and provide a new treatment idea for further improving the prognosis of patients with idiopathic facial paralysis.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Circadian disruption is associated with both an increased risk of breast cancer, and poor survival in patients (pts) with metastatic cancer (IARC#98; Innominato et al. Cancer Res 2009). Objective: to provide first evidence of clinical relevance of clock genes expression for the therapeutic sensitivity of primary breast cancer. Method: Affymetrix Hgu133plus2 microarrays data were derived from 189 primary breast cancers. All the pts had non metastatic disease and were registered in multicenter Phase II trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin-cyclophosphamide (4 courses) then docetaxel \u00b1 herceptin (4 courses). In this study, negative hormonal receptor status and limited tumor size predicted for pathological complete response rate (pCR) (Pierga JY, et al Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2010).The expression data of 15 core clock genes, within the whole tumor transcriptome, were related both to tumor mitotic index (MI) and estrogen receptors (ESR1), and to chemotherapy-induced pCR. Statistical validation involved T-test statistics, with corrections for multiple testing. Results: In the tumor biopsy obtained before treatment onset, both Per2 and Cry2 expressions correlated positively with ESR1 (r\u22650.43; P&lt;0.001) and inversely with (MI (r\u2264\u22120.28; P&lt;0.007). In addition, a positive correlation was found for Dec 1 with ESR1 (r=0.65, P&lt;0.001). The mean expressions of Per2, Cry2 and Dec 1 before chemotherapy were lower in the 32 pts who subsequently achieved pathologic complete response (pCR) as compared to the 157 who did not (P&lt;0.001). No other clock gene expression was significantly related to pCR. The odds ratio confirmed the decreased chance of achieving pCR with increased expression of clock genes Per2, Cry2 or Dec1. Clock gene expression and pCR Conclusion: Low expressions of three core genes in the negative loop of the molecular circadian clock strongly predicted for the induction of a pathologic complete response of primary breast cancer with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. While circadian clock disruption seems to constitute a poor prognostic factor in cancer patients, our data suggest that the downregulation of core circadian genes in tumors significantly enhances susceptibility to chemotherapy.

The sorption capacity for As(V) at pH 3 increased by 5.7-fold after surface modification. The sorption performances including kinetics and isotherm were investigated and several models were used to describe the experimental data.

CD34+ enriched fresh ABM was obtained using the method as described previously.a,b However, we used frozen CB and the same cytokines for both ABM and CB expansion whereas Chute et al used fresh CB and different cytokines. Ex vivo expansion studies for both ABM and CB were performed for 7 days in the HUBEC coated plates with previously reported cell density and cytokine cocktail containing GM-CSF, IL-3, IL-6, SCF, and flt-3 (GM36SF) in IMDM 10% FBS media.a HSC injections and BM harvesting of NOD-SCID mice as well as flow cytometric analysis were performed using the methods of Chute et al.a NOD-SCID mice were transplanted with limiting doses of either fresh ABM CD34+ cells or freshly thawed CB CD34+. The progeny of the identical doses of ABM CD34+ or the progeny of the identical doses of CB CD34+ cells was then transplanted. Culture with GM36SF alone resulted in a 15.5-fold and 70-fold increase in total cells, a 3.4-fold and 32-fold increase in CD34+ cells, and a 4.8-fold and 4.1-fold increase in CD34+/CD38- cells for ABM and CB, respectively. In contrast, HUBEC co-culture with GM36SF yielded a 25-fold and 48-fold increase in total cells, a 8.9-fold and 13-fold increase in CD34+ cells, and 114-fold and 106-fold increase in CD34+/CD38- cells for ABM and CB, respectively. HUBEC co-culture without GM36SF supported a 1.0-fold and 1.0-fold increase in total cells, a 0.06-fold and 0.1-fold increase in CD34+ cells, and 0.25-fold and 0.2-fold increase in CD34+/CD38- cells for ABM and CB. HUBEC co-culture with GM36SF and transwell (non-contact culture) resulted in a 20-fold and 48-fold increase in total cells, a 6-fold and 8-fold increase in CD34+ cells, and a 32-fold and 38-fold increase in CD34+/CD38- cells for ABM and CB. Overall, the transwell expansion of CD34+/CD38- population in both ABM and CB was reduced to 30% of that achieved in the contact culture. ABM CD34+ cells (5 x 105) engrafted 60% and the progeny of 5 x 105 cultured in the HUBEC monolayer with GM36SF engrafted in 90% of transplanted mice.

Finally, in vitro experiments demonstrated that suppression of Skp2 expression drastically reduced proliferation of thyroid cancer cells and, conversely, forced expression of Skp2 circumvented serum dependency and contact inhibition in Skp2-negative cells by promoting p27 degradation.

insertion leads to more facile re-entry and easier cardiac transplantation. We hypothesize minimally invasive LVAD implantation results in improved outcomes at the time of subsequent heart transplant. Methods All adults undergoing cardiac transplantation between October 2015 and March 2019 at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Those bridged to transplantation with a HeartWare HVAD were identified and divided into 2 cohorts based upon the surgical approach: those who underwent HVAD placement by conventional sternotomy versus minimally invasive insertion via lateral thoracotomy and hemisternotomy (LTHS). Patient demographics, as well as perioperative transplant outcomes, including survival, length of stay (LOS), blood utilization, ischemic time, bypass time, and postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were compared between cohorts. Results Forty-two patients were bridged to heart transplant with a HVAD implanted via either sternotomy ( n = 22) or LTHS technique ( n = 20). Demographics were similar between groups. There was 1 predischarge death in the sternotomy group and none in the LTHS group. Body surface area, cardiopulmonary bypass time, ischemic time, ECMO utilization, and reoperation for bleeding were similar. Red blood cell units transfused were significantly lower in the LTHS cohort (3.0 [1.0-5.0] vs 6.0 [2.5-10.0] P = 0.046). The LTHS cohort had a significantly shorter hospital LOS (12.0 [11.0-28.0] vs 22.5 [15.7-41.7] P = 0.022) with a trend toward shorter intensive care unit LOS (6.0 [5.0-10.5] vs 11.0 [6.0-21.5] days P = 0.057). Conclusions Minimally invasive HVAD implantation improves outcomes at subsequent heart transplantation, resulting in shorter LOS and less red cell transfusion. Larger multi-institutional studies are necessary to validate these findings.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Organic Chemistry\", \"Biochemistry\"]", "language": "en", "length": [66, 20, 0], "string": "title={11th Amendment barred student's efforts to re\u2010enroll in med school}, container_title={Campus Legal Advisor}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Surgery\"]", "language": "en", "length": [59, 0, 945], "string": "title={Septic arthritis in the era of immunosuppressive treatments}, container_title={}, abstract={Immunosuppressants have been the mainstay of treatment for certain inflammatory joint conditions for many years.

In the present work, experiments on two-phase flow have been performed in a large scale test facility with the length of 6 m and diameter of 5 cm. Four main flow regimes have been observed in vertical air-water two-phase flow at moderate superficial velocities of gas and water namely: Bubbly, Slug, Churn, and Annular. An image processing technique was used to extract information from each picture. This information includes the number of bubbles or objects, area, perimeter, as well as the height and width of objects (second phase). In addition, a texture feature extraction procedure was applied to images of different regimes. Some features which were adequate for regime identification were extracted such as contrast, energy, entropy, etc. To identify flow regimes, a fuzzy interface was introduced using characteristic of second phase in picture. Furthermore, an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy (ANFIS) was used to identify flow patterns using textural features of images. The experimental results show that these methods can accurately identify the flow patterns in a vertical pipe.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Inorganic Chemistry\", \"Organic Chemistry\", \"Physical and Theoretical Chemistry\", \"Computer Science Applications\", \"Spectroscopy\", \"Molecular Biology\", \"Catalysis\"]", "language": "en", "length": [148, 0, 1443], "string": "title={A Fungal Versatile GH10 Endoxylanase and Its Glycosynthase Variant: Synthesis of Xylooligosaccharides and Glycosides of Bioactive Phenolic Compounds}, container_title={}, abstract={The study of endoxylanases as catalysts to valorize hemicellulosic residues and to obtain glycosides with improved properties is a topic of great industrial interest. In this work, a GH10 \u03b2-1,4-endoxylanase (XynSOS), from the ascomycetous fungus Talaromyces amestolkiae, has been heterologously produced in Pichia pastoris, purified, and characterized. rXynSOS is a highly glycosylated monomeric enzyme of 53 kDa that contains a functional CBM1 domain and shows its optimal activity on azurine cross-linked (AZCL)\u2013beechwood xylan at 70 \u00b0C and pH 5. Substrate specificity and kinetic studies confirmed its versatility and high affinity for beechwood xylan and wheat arabinoxylan. Moreover, rXynSOS was capable of transglycosylating phenolic compounds, although with low efficiencies. For expanding its synthetic capacity, a glycosynthase variant of rXynSOS was developed by directed mutagenesis, replacing its nucleophile catalytic residue E236 by a glycine (rXynSOS-E236G). This novel glycosynthase was able to synthesize \u03b2-1,4-xylooligosaccharides (XOS) of different lengths (four, six, eight, and ten xylose units), which are known to be emerging prebiotics. rXynSOS-E236G was also much more active than the native enzyme in the glycosylation of a broad range of phenolic compounds with antioxidant properties.

Patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: Incidence and Risk Factors}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Abstract 4586 Introduction: Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have infiltrative bone marrow changes in vertebral bodies on radiographic studies. Whether CLL is associated with an increased risk of compression fracture and/or osteoporosis in correlation with the burden or duration of the disease has not been studied. For this purpose, we performed a retrospective case-control study. Methods: After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval, we reviewed the records of CLL patients managed in our centers with watchful waiting from diagnosis until treatment. Data on demographic, clinical and laboratory variables, radiographic findings and treatment were collected. Presence of osteoporosis and compression fractures was ascertained from physician evaluation notes, bone densitometry studies and/or computed tomography (CT) scan results prior to initiation of chemotherapy. CLL cases were matched by age, sex and body mass index (BMI) at 1:2 ratio to healthy controls derived from a local Family Practice database. Cox regression models were used for the evaluation of hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for factors associated with compression fractures in patients with CLL undergoing a watchful waiting approach. Results: Among 96 CLL cases included in the analysis there were 48% women, 10% current and 34% former smokers. The median age was 71 years (range, 44\u201399), median BMI 26 (18\u201350) and median follow up time 2.9 years (0\u201322, with the last follow up between 2003 and 2012). The median absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) was 40,850/mm3 (5,700\u2013969,000/mm3), mean hemoglobin 12.4 g/dL (+/\u2212 2.2 g/dL), lactate dehydrogenase 202 IU/L (+/\u2212 95 IU/L), 25-OH-vitamin D 30.7 ng/mL (+/\u2212 12.3 ng/mL). Staging CT scans were available in 68% of cases, but bone density scans only in 13% (2% men, 24% women). Chemotherapy was started in 41% of patients after a median time of 2.4 years from diagnosis. Osteoporosis and osteopenia were each recorded in 12% of patients while a vertebral compression fracture was present in 7%. With marked differences in the availability of evaluation tests (e.g. bone density, p In the time-to-event analysis, the rate of compression fracture occurrence was 1.7% per year (95%CI 0.8\u20133.6%). Compression fractures in CLL patients were associated with underlying osteoporosis or osteopenia (HR 12.8, 95%CI 1.5\u2013109, p=0.004), ALC over 100,000/mm3 (HR 5.1, 95%CI 1.1\u201323.7, p=0.04) and anemia, defined as hemoglobin less than 12 g/dL (HR 8.9, 95%CI 1.1\u201374, P=0.01, Fig.1). Conclusions: CLL patients managed with watchful waiting may be at risk of vertebral compression fractures proportional to the burden of disease. Further prospective research may delineate potential role for screening for osteoporosis and prevention of osteoporosis and vertebral fractures in this population.

reductions in recovery time and scarring for the patient. While techniques and instruments for performing laparoscopic surgery have improved over the years, loss of vision through the endoscopic lens caused by fog, liquid, and solid debris common to laparoscopic procedures remains a significant problem. In this paper, a shielding mechanism that maintains visibility through the laparoscope by removing debris from the distal end of the lens is presented. This device provides an inexpensive and convenient alternative to the current practice of removing, cleaning, and re-inserting the laparoscope during surgical procedures. This device is shown in multiple trials to repeatably remove debris from the distal tip of the lens, thereby restoring vision for the surgeon without requiring removal or reinsertion of the endoscope.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

quality characteristics of products in manufacturing processes. Several process monitoring based on machine learning algorithms have been proposed in the literature and have gained the attention of many researchers. In this paper, the authors developed machine learning-based control charts for monitoring fraction non-conforming products in smart manufacturing. This study proposed a relevance vector machine using Bayesian sparse kernel optimized by differential evolution algorithm for efficient monitoring in manufacturing.Design/methodology/approachA new approach was carried out about data analysis, modelling and monitoring in the manufacturing industry. This study developed a relevance vector machine using Bayesian sparse kernel technique to improve the support vector machine used to both regression and classification problems. The authors compared the performance of proposed relevance vector machine with other machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machine, artificial neural network and beta regression model. The proposed approach was evaluated by different shift scenarios of average run length using Monte Carlo simulation.FindingsThe authors analyse a real case study in a manufacturing company, based on best machine learning algorithms. The results indicate that proposed relevance vector machine-based process monitoring are excellent quality tools for monitoring defective products in manufacturing process. A comparative analysis with four machine learning models is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The relevance vector machine has slightly better performance than support vector machine, artificial neural network and beta models.Originality/valueThis research is different from the others by providing approaches for monitoring defective products. Machine learning-based control charts are used to monitor product failures in smart manufacturing process. Besides, the key contribution of this study is to develop different models for fault detection and to identify any change point in the manufacturing process. Moreover, the authors\u2019 research indicates that machine learning models are adequate tools for the modelling and monitoring of the fraction non-conforming product in the industrial process.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Demography\"]", "language": "fr", "length": [137, 0, 0], "string": "title={La contribution des \u00e9trangers \u00e0 la population de la France entre le 1er janvier 1946 et le 1er janvier 1980.

Nondenaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (non-dHPLC) with use of a WAVE microbial analysis system is a promising method of PCR amplicon analysis as it is low cost and requires no preanalysis processing. The aims of this study were to validate the application of WAVE microbial analysis system technology to MIRU-VNTR typing. A collection of 70 strains were cultivated in liquid culture and extracted using the QIAamp DNA minikit. Novel primers were designed to target the 12 MIRU-VNTR loci (P. Supply et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 39: 3563-3571, 2001). After amplification, each PCR product was analyzed on a WAVE microbial analysis system. The fragment size was calculated from the chromatogram, and the number of tandem repeats at each locus was determined. For the collection of 70 strains 100% concordance was achieved when comparing MIRU-VNTR profiles obtained from agarose gel electrophoresis and PCRs analyzed on a WAVE microbial analysis system. The calculated fragment sizes, obtained from the WAVE microbial analysis system, were sufficiently accurate to ensure 100% confidence when assigning the number of tandem repeats to a MIRU-VNTR locus. This study is the first to report the successful use of non-dHPLC for screening for variations in the number of MIRU-VNTRs in mycobacterial DNA. Non-dHPLC analysis was demonstrated to be a rapid, low-labor input method for the detection and analysis of MIRU-VNTR amplicons. The combination with non-dHPLC further enhances the utility of MIRU-VNTR typing.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Infectious Diseases\", \"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health\", \"Molecular Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [125, 7, 0], "string": "title={Live attenuated Bordetella pertussis vaccine candidate BPZE1 transiently protects against lethal pneumococcal disease in mice}, container_title={Vaccine}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Neurology (clinical)\", \"Neurology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [14, 0, 0], "string": "title={News and notes}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Education\"]", "language": "en", "length": [47, 0, 0], "string": "title={Portfolio assessment: direct from the classroom}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cell Biology\", \"Hematology\", \"Immunology\", \"Biochemistry\"]", "language": "en", "length": [84, 5, 2667], "string": "title={Quality of Life of Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplatic Syndrome.}, container_title={Blood}, abstract={Abstract Background: Over the last decades, outcome from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) has improved due to better treatment. However, little is still known about Quality of Life (QoL) of patients treated. Methods: QoL was evaluated in patients who were randomized between April 2003 and September 2004 for treatment for AML and MDS in the German AMLCG99 trial at the university hospital of Munich-Grosshadern, Germany. QoL was evaluated using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. During inhouse and out-patient treatment, QoL was evaluated at eight consecutive time points. Besides leukemia-specific data, duration of inhouse treatment, duration of leukocytopenia and maximal c-reactive protein (CRP max), hemoglobine levels were evaluated. QoL results were compared to already published data from normal German population and patients with small cell lung cancer. Results: In total, 57 patients were treated, of which 76,3% had a de-novo AML, 20,3% a secondary AML and two patients an MDS. Median event-free survival was 15,4 months. QoL data from 49 patients, who filled in a total number of 238 QLQ-C30 questionnaires, was available for analysis. Ten patients received allogeneic stem cell or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) instead of cyclic maintainance therapy. Scores for global health status were low in the beginning, but improved significantly during treatment, finally reaching levels, that were not significantly different from normal population. No differences were seen for patients who subsequently went off protocol due to relapse or death, for karyotype or initial lactate dehydrogenases (LDH). There were neither any differences in between age groups, induction therapy groups, for patients receiving g-csf priming and those who did not or in between older patients receiving a 2nd induction chemotherapy and those who did not. Global health status did not correlate with duation of inhouse treatment, with duration of Leukocytopenia or CRP max. Physical functioning and fatigue mainly accounted for global health status and were correlating with other functional and symptome scores. However, hemoglobin levels did not show high correlation with physical functioning or fatigue. Social functioning was significantly better for older patients (60 years and older) at the end of treatment than it was for younger ones. BMT was worsening physical and social functioning at the end of inpatient treatment, however, differences disappeared during further evaluation of QoL. Conclusion: Rather because of than despite treatment, patient\u2019s QoL was improving during time, partially even reaching levels of normal population.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

NODE METASTASES IN A PATIENT WITH BREAST CANCER: A CASE REPORT}, container_title={Siberian journal of oncology}, abstract={Background. The parasternal lymphatic collector is an important pathway of the lymph drainage from the breast in breast cancer patients. Evaluation of parasternal lymph nodes is not available during physical examination. To date, no algorithm for diagnostic imaging of the parasternal lymphatic pathway has been developed. The presence of metastases in parasternal lymph nodes upstages the breast cancer patient to a minimum of clinical stage III disease.Case description. We present the case of breast cancer progression in a 40-year-old woman. The patient received treatment for triple-negative stage IIA breast cancer (\u04222N0M0) in 2018. In August, 2019, 18-FDG PET /CT images revealed a solitary metastasis in the parasternal lymph node. Ultrasound images also showed the same lymph node assessed by PET -CT and the additional parasternal lymph node metastasis. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy of both lymph nodes confirmed the specific involvement of the parasternal lymph nodes.Conclusion. Ultrasound scans are used to assess the axillary, subclavian and supraclavicular lymphatic collectors, but there is little evidence in the literature on the use of ultrasound in the assessment of parasternal lymph nodes. Our clinical case shows the feasibility of using ultrasound in assessing the status of the parasternal of lymph nodes, as well as the feasibility of performing fine-needle aspiration biopsy by ultrasound navigation.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Hepatology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [8, 0, 0], "string": "title={Contents}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Biomedical Engineering\"]", "language": "en", "length": [129, 32, 0], "string": "title={Design of a Modular Bioreactor to Incorporate Both Perfusion Flow and Hydrostatic Compression for Tissue Engineering Applications}, container_title={Annals of Biomedical Engineering}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Energy Engineering and Power Technology\", \"Software\"]", "language": "en", "length": [80, 26, 0], "string": "title={Target tracking with a dynamic and adaptive selection of radars based on entropy}, container_title={The Journal of Engineering}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Obstetrics and Gynecology\", \"Obstetrics and Gynecology\", \"Obstetrics and Gynecology\", \"Obstetrics and Gynecology\"]", "language": "de", "length": [108, 0, 0], "string": "title={Hormonkonzentrationen im Plasma und Wehent\ufffdtigkeit bei Prostaglandin F2?

Australia is expected to harbour a rich diversity of heterostigmatic mites; however, its phoretic fauna and its host associations remain mainly unexplored. We conducted a short exploration of Australian insect-associated phoretic mites in summer 2020 and found two new phoretic heterostigmatic species on a semiaquatic hydrophilid beetle species, Coelostoma fabricii (Montrouzier, 1860) (Coleoptera: Hydrophilidae).

elaborar uma proposta de constru\u00e7\u00e3o de um LEM. Desse modo, buscou-se na literatura as concep\u00e7\u00f5es, possibilidades e limites do Laborat\u00f3rio de Ensino de Matem\u00e1tica, relatos de experi\u00eancias com o LEM, bem como a import\u00e2ncia e potencialidades de utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de materiais concretos nas aulas da Matem\u00e1tica. Esta \u00e9 uma pesquisa de natureza qualitativa, em que se realizaram visitas a tr\u00eas Laborat\u00f3rios para coleta de dados sobre implanta\u00e7\u00e3o e funcionamento, aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de question\u00e1rios e realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de entrevistas com os coordenadores. Al\u00e9m disso, dados foram obtidos tamb\u00e9m por meio de documentos e relat\u00f3rios institucionais. A an\u00e1lise dos dados revelou que os Laborat\u00f3rios investigados t\u00eam buscado desenvolver atividades que motivem a aprendizagem Matem\u00e1tica e que o conhecimento seja constru\u00eddo por meio de materiais manipulativos. O referencial te\u00f3rico e a an\u00e1lise dos dados obtidos em campo serviram de subs\u00eddios para a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de uma proposta de Laborat\u00f3rio de Ensino de Matem\u00e1tica em dois campi do Instituto Federal, na Bahia. Esse LEM proposto tem por objetivo principal desenvolver e aplicar estrat\u00e9gias que permitam a constru\u00e7\u00e3o do conhecimento dos alunos utilizando materiais manipulativos que incentivem os alunos a refletir, discutir, comparar, associar e validar os conhecimentos matem\u00e1ticos.

Management of this entity is controversial. This retrospective study aims to evaluate the impact of PUC histology on clinical outcomes with ctx compared to UC-NOS. Methods: Consecutive cases of nonmetastatic PUC were identified as either (1) localized disease (LD: cT2-3 cN0) or (2) locally-advanced (LA: fixed bladder or radiographic nodal disease). All cases were reviewed by a GU pathologist to confirm PUC histology per WHO classification (2016). A separate cohort of neoadjuvant(NAC)-treated UC-NOS (Tully et al, ASCO GU 2014) served as comparator for clinical outcomes. Kaplan-Meier estimates and logrank test were used for analysis of recurrence free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) defined from date of cystectomy (RC). Results: Between 2000 and 2017, eighty one PUC were identified, with median age of 65 years (range: 22 - 84) and 65% male. Thirty patients (pts) had up-front RC; 51 pts had ctx. In the former group, all pts had LD but upstaging was seen on post-op pathology: 63% pT3, 17% pT4 and 37% pN+. Among ctx pts, 33/51(65%) were LD and had NAC: 70% had ctx doublet and 24% triplet; 82% had 4 cycles and 18% had up to 6 cycles.

Cohort Study}, container_title={}, abstract={Background: We sought to identify the absolute risk of specific HPV genotype for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3 or worse (CIN2+/3+) and to develop a risk-based management strategy in an HPV-positive population. Methods: HPV genotyping was performed based on a 3-year cervical cancer screening cohort. The study endpoints were histologic CIN2+/3+. The prevalence of specific HPV genotype was calculated by minimum, any type, and hierarchical attribution estimate. The absolute CIN2+/3+ risks of specific HPV genotype were estimated and risk-based management strategy was established according to the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology guideline. The efficacy of conventional and risk-based management strategies for non-16/18 HPVs were further evaluated. Results: Eligible data were available for 8,370 women with a median age of 48 years (interquartile range, 42\u201353 years). At baseline, there were 1,062 women with HPV-positive disease, including 424 with multiple and 639 with single infections. CIN2+/3+ cases represented 113/74, 23/8, 20/7, and 52/31 patients at baseline and first-, second-, and third-year visits, respectively. Women with multiple HPV infections at baseline were more prone to persistent infection than those with single infection (PP=.0000) and positive predictive value (P=.0322) to detect CIN3+ and needed fewer colposcopies for each CIN3+ case. Conclusions: Based on our study findings, we propose a new extended HPV genotyping protocol, which would provide a better strategy for achieving precise risk-based management of HPV-positive populations.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

A retrospective review of all trephine biopsies done over 12 years (January 2000 to December 2012) in Department of pathology was done and all trephine biopsies showing MN were identified and studied. Results. Twenty-five cases accounting for 0.4% were identified. Fever and generalized weakness were the common presenting symptoms. Anemia was seen in all cases followed by thrombocytopaenia. Malignancy was the underlying cause in 64% of cases; hematolymphoid malignancy was seen in two-thirds and solid malignancies in one-third of the cases. Tuberculosis accounted for 16% of the cases and the etiology was unknown in 12%. Conclusions. The causes of MN are varied and hematological malignancy and solid malignancies are the most common causes. Presence of myelonecrosis is associated with a poor prognosis. Myelonecrosis may obscure the underlying disorder and hence a thorough search in the bone marrow biopsy itself with the help of immunohistochemistry may prove worthwhile in identifying the underlying

disease (COPD) is one of the greatest global public health challenges. Acute exacerbations of COPD lead to the accelerated deterioration of lung function, reduced quality of life, a higher number of hospitalizations, and increased mortality. The factor causing the exacerbation is usually an infectious agent, but the impact of environmental factors is being studied more thoroughly. Among them, meteorological factors are the least examined. Multiple studies have shown that lower temperatures during the cold season, as well as sudden temperature changes regardless of the season, have the most significant negative effect on patients with COPD. However, higher temperatures, especially during summer heatwaves, can also cause COPD exacerbation and it is expected that this will be an even more important health problem in the future considering climate changes. The effects of other meteorological factors on acute exacerbation of COPD, such as atmospheric pressure, solar radiation, rainfall, wind speed, and humidity are far less investigated and opposing results have been obtained in different studies. Thus, there is a need for further research in this area that would result in clinical recommendations and public health interventions that could decrease the global burden of COPD.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Infectious Diseases\", \"Animal Science and Zoology\", \"Parasitology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [98, 0, 0], "string": "title={Artificially decreased dissolved oxygen increases the persistence of Trichomonas gallinae in water}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Mechanical Engineering\"]", "language": "en", "length": [129, 25, 1659], "string": "title={Analysis of the Unsteady Flow Field at Stall Conditions for a Low-Speed Low-Pressure Ratio Axial Fan With Full-Annulus Simulation}, container_title={Journal of Turbomachinery}, abstract={Abstract The present work analyzes the three-dimensional unsteady flow structure of a low-speed low-pressure ratio axial fan stage operating at stall conditions. Unsteady numerical simulations were conducted with the elsA software, which solves the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier\u2013Stokes (URANS) equations on a full-annulus calculation domain for the rotor and the stator. The analyses will focus on a near stall operating point, the stall inception mechanisms, and the final rotating stall pattern. Numerical simulations are confronted with experimental measurements from high-frequency Kulite transducers mounted on the casing near the rotor blades and the stator blades. The results show that boundary layer separation occurs on the stator blade close to the hub region at near stall conditions. The reverse flow interacts with the main flow to form a vortex shedding phenomenon. The frequency is not clocked with the blade passage frequency, requiring unsteady full-annulus methodology even for a stable operating point. It is also shown that the final state of the rotating stall region is composed of a single part-span cell that occupies three-quarters of the circumference and rotates at 60% of the shaft speed. This pattern agrees with the experimental measurements in terms of both the number of cells and the rotational speed. Finally, the paper demonstrates that without inlet distortion, the mechanism of the onset of the rotating stall is incorrectly predicted by the simulation. However, when a total pressure inlet distortion is applied, the computational fluid dynamics produces the same inception mechanism that is observed experimentally.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [74, 0, 0], "string": "title={Inversionless gain in an optically-dense resonant Doppler-broadened medium}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Genetics\", \"Molecular Biology\", \"Biotechnology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [116, 0, 890], "string": "title={BrdU-4Na-EDTA-Giemsa band karyotypes of 3 small freshwater fish, Danio rerio, Oryzias latipes, and Rhodeus ocellatus}, container_title={}, abstract={The 4Na-EDTA-Giemsa staining of metaphase chromosomes from embryos of three small freshwater fish, zebrafish Danio rerio, medakafish Oryzias latipes, and rosy bitterling Rhodeus ocellatus, in the presence of BrdU for one cycle gave rise to clear bands along the length of the chromosomes.

container_title={}, abstract={Background Wire-loop lesion (WL) is one of the active lesions of lupus nephritis (LN). However, few reports have focused on the clinicopathological relationships of WL to serological immune abnormality and renal prognosis. Methods We enrolled 126 Japanese LN patients subjected to renal biopsy in 11 hospitals from 2000 to 2018. In patients with class III or IV of the International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society classification, we retrospectively compared clinicopathological findings between those with WL (WL+ group) and without WL (WL\u2013 group) to detect factors associated with WL. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 2 for more than three months. We also compared these findings between those with CKD (CKD+ group) and without CKD (CKD\u2013 group) at the last visit to investigate factors associated with renal prognosis. Results Of 126 patients, 100 (79.4%) were classified as class III or IV. WL was found in 36 (36.0%) of them. Although the renal function did not differ, the WL+ group had a higher titre of serum anti-dsDNA antibodies and lower serum complement 3 levels than the WL\u2013 group. Linear regression analysis revealed a significant association only between anti-dsDNA antibodies and WL (\u03b2 = 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.001\u20130.100, p = 0.01). Of these patients, 69 were tracked for 59.6 \u00b1 55.1 months. Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis showed no difference in renal prognosis between these groups. Next, the CKD+ group included 15 (22.1%) patients. They were older and had higher frequencies of hypertension and hyperuricaemia, serum creatinine (Cr) level, glomerulosclerosis, interstitial inflammation, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy than the CKD\u2013 group at the time of renal biopsy. The frequency of WL was not significantly different. Cox regression analysis revealed significant associations of CKD with hypertension, hyperuricaemia, serum Cr level at the time of renal biopsy clinically and with tubular atrophy histologically. Conclusions WL was associated with serum anti-dsDNA antibodies but not with renal prognosis, suggesting that WL reflects immune abnormality but is not an independent factor predictive of renal prognosis in LN.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Behavioral Neuroscience\", \"Endocrine and Autonomic Systems\", \"Immunology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [27, 29, 0], "string": "title={PNIRS Society Announcements}, container_title={Brain, Behavior, and Immunity}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)\", \"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management\"]", "language": "en", "length": [64, 33, 276], "string": "title={The Assessment Centre is Not Dead!

The two wells drilled by American Petrofina Co. of Texas and partners are located 1,700 ft apart. One well was partially successful before being shut in due to mechanical problems. The second well is now in its fifth cycle and has recovered 43,900 bbl of the 5 deg. API oil in 18 months. This project illustrates a situation where thermal recovery has provided an effective production technique for a reservoir which previously had been considered nonproductive. Introduction The Vaca Tar sand is in the Oxnard field, Ventura County, Calif. The field lies just east of the city limits of Oxnard which is located on the Pacific coast 40 miles north- west of Los Angeles. The reservoir. defined by deeper wells in the Oxnard field, covers approximately 1,700 acres. Several early completion attempts in the Vaca Tar sand were unsuccessful due to sand influx resulting from the combination of a viscous crude and an unconsolidated sand. A cyclic steam project was initiated to determine if the viscous crude could be produced by thermal techniques. When the viscosity of the crude around the wellbore was lowered by steam injection, the wells could produce the crude through gravel-packed completions without having sand entry. Production results show that the reservoir has prolific production capacity under cyclic steam operations. History The Vaca Tar sand was discovered in Jan., 1937, by Vaca Oil Exploration Co.'s Well 1 located in the south-west corner of what is now American Petrofina's Vacca Transamerica lease. The well established a production rate of 50 B/D but was abandoned because production could not be maintained due to sand influx. In May, 1937, a second well in the area discovered low-gravity oil in a fractured shale reservoir 500 ft below the base of the Vaca Tar sand. Subsequent drilling was to reach the low-gravity oil in the fractured shale, and the Vaca Tar sand was not exploited. Attempts were made to recomplete three such wells in the sand as salvage projects before abandonment. The zone was gun perforated, but sand influx resulted. In 1953, oil was discovered in the Sespe zone at 6,000 ft, and wells drilled to this formation provided additional geologic control for the Vaca Tar sand. The Vaca Tar sand remained in a virgin state until Dec., 1964, when American Petrofina initiated the thermal recovery project by drilling and steaming Vacca Transamerica Well 203. In Feb., 1965, three core holes were drilled on the Hunsucker tract, a northeast offset to the Vacca TransAmerica lease, to gain more reservoir data and establish the continuity of the sand in this area. In May, 1965, Well 203 was shut in due to down-hole mechanical problems. Vacca Transamerica Well 702 was completed in June, 1965, and has been produced by cyclic steam injection since that time. In partnership on the project with American Petrofina are Helmerich and Payne, Inc, and Kewanee Oil Co. Geology The Vaca Tar sand is Pliocene in age and overlies a Miocene unconformity in most areas.* The sand is fine- to medium-grained with scattered coarse grains and pebbles. Cores show the sand to be totally unconsolidated with sand grains held together by the viscous tar. The structure is a northeast-southwest trending homocline, dipping about 151 to the northwest. The Vaca Tar sand has a productive area of approximately 1,700 acres.* Average depth to the top of the pay in American Petrofina's project, located in the northeast portion of the reservoir, is 1,870 ft. Of the five wells drilled by American Petrofina, one did not penetrate the entire pay section and the other four had gross pay thicknesses ranging from 103 to 480 ft with corresponding net pay thicknesses ranging from 76 to 435 ft. Fig. 1 is a map of the net pay. Fresh water lenses exist in the upper portion of the sand in some wells, the most prominent of which is in the Vacca Transamerica Well 203 (Fig. 2).

We have identified Nr4a1, Nr4a2, and Jmjd3, which are critical for the maintenance of HSC functions, as previously unrecognized downstream targets of c-Myc in HSCs. c-Myc directly binds to the promoter regions of Nr4a1, Nr4a2, and Jmjd3 and regulates their expression. Our results revealed that Nr4a1 and Nr4a2 mediates the function of c-Myc in regulating HSC quiescence, whereas all 3 genes contribute to the function of c-Myc in the maintenance of HSC survival. Adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) is a negative regulator of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. We have provided the first evidence that Apc haploinsufficiency induces a blockage of erythroid lineage differentiation through promoting secretion of IL6 in bone marrow endothelial cells. We found that c-Myc haploinsufficiency failed to rescue defective function of Apc-deficient HSCs in vivo but it was sufficient to prevent the development of severe anemia in Apc\u2013heterozygous mice and to significantly prolong the survival of those mice. Furthermore, we showed that c-Myc\u2013mediated Apc loss induced IL6 secretion in endothelial cells, and c-Myc haploinsufficiency reversed the negative effect of Apc-deficient endothelial cells on erythroid cell differentiation. Our studies indicate that c-Myc has a context-dependent role in mediating the function of Apc in hematopoiesis.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Case Reports in Internal Medicine}, abstract={Oesophageal varices are a dilated submucosal venous plexus in the lower third of the oesophagus which result from increased pressure in the portal venous system. The portal system is connected to the systemic circulation in specific locations referred to as sites of portosystemic anastomosis. An increase in portal venous pressure is therefore reflected at these anastomotic sites, causing manifestations such as oesophageal varices, rectal varices, caput medusae and splenorenal shunts. Varices do not cause symptoms until they leak or rupture and this is the main complication which requires prompt treatment. Here, we present a post-liver transplant patient with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma who had oesophageal varices that fistularized with a left pulmonary vein, thus creating a right-to-left shunt. Right-to-left shunts are usually intracardiac or intrapulmonary in location. The complications of a right-to-left shunt include predominantly hypoxia, cyanosis and, sometimes, paradoxical emboli in the case of intracardiac shunts. This patient had a very uncommon cause of such a shunt caused by a direct fistulous connection.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

We show examples of our imaging results dealing with cavity modes, single-, and multi-soliton dynamics in Josephson tunnel junctions made from Nb and Pb-alloy superconductors as well as cavity modes in grain boundary Josephson junctions made from the high-critical-temperature superconductor YBa2Cu3O 7-\u03b4. With high-quality Nb and Pb-alloy junctions we are able to confirm existing theoretical models about cavity resonances and soliton dynamics.

Method 50 plain films of randomly selected (using random number generator) who had attended new patient fracture clinic and ward. An initial audit was done in June and an reaudit in September. The radiology system, clinical notes and clinic letters were reviewed to obtain the relevant data. Results Audit: 20 films were documented 30 were not documented Reaudit 32 films were documented by referring clinician 18 films were not documented by referring clinician Audit: Clinical evaluation documented 18 Clinical evaluation not documented 32 Reaudit: Clinical evaluation documented - 29 Clinical evaluation not documented - 21 Discussion Whose responsibility? Radiographs commented on in trauma meetings not documented. New radiographs not commented on in clinic. Limitations - access to more notes from ward. Conclusions As outlined in guidance orthopaedic and fracture clinic plain films should be reported by referring clinician or their team. Currently this is being done 64% of the time, significant improvement was seen. This may have medicolegal consequences as it does not follow GMC guidance for good medical practise.

For most of the people the early diagnosis of CKD is often not possible. Therefore, the utilization of present-day Computer aided supported strategies is important to help the conventional CKD finding framework to be progressively effective and precise. In this project, six modern machine learning techniques namely Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, Na\u00efve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Logistic regression were used and then to enhance the performance of the model Ensemble Algorithms such as ADABoost, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Majority Voting, Bagging and Weighted Average were used on the Chronic Kidney Disease dataset from the UCI Repository. The model was tuned finely to get the best hyper parameters to train the model. The performance metrics used to evaluate the model was measured using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Mathew`s Correlation Coefficient and ROC-AUC curve. The experiment was first performed on the individual classifiers and then on the Ensemble classifiers.
