Enhancing ACE2 activity using GSK2586881, a recombinant form of human ACE2, could be beneficial in diseases such as ARDS but may blunt the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) response and potentially impact systemic and tissue oxygenation. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of GSK2586881 0.8\u00c2\u00a0mg/kg on HPV response in healthy adult volunteers during exercise under hypoxic conditions. Methods: In this phase I, randomised, double-blind (sponsor open) study, GSK2586881 or placebo was administered as a single intravenous (IV) dose in a two-period crossover design. Treatment periods were separated by a washout period of 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c14\u00c2\u00a0days. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) measured by echocardiography. Secondary endpoints included RAS peptides and oxygen saturation. Results: Seventeen adults aged 18\u00e2\u20ac\u201c40\u00c2\u00a0years were randomised to treatment. There were no clinically relevant differences (defined as a reduction of \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 5\u00c2\u00a0mmHg) in change from baseline in PASP between GSK2586881 and placebo. GSK2586881 was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events, no worsening of hypoxaemia and no evidence of immunogenicity. The study was terminated early after review of the data, which showed that the predefined success criteria had not been met. Following GSK2586881 administration, levels of the RAS peptide angiotensin II decreased while angiotensin (1-7) increased, as expected, indicating that GSK2586881 was pharmacologically active. Conclusions: A single IV dose of GSK2586881 0.8\u00c2\u00a0mg/kg was well tolerated but did not impact the acute HPV response in healthy volunteers. \u00c2\u00a9 2021, The Author(s).}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], "reverse": ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "Respiratory Care"]}]}
