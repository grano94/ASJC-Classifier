The knowledge that atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease and coagulation affects the disease\u2019s complications offers new opportunities for prevention and treatment. Population studies demonstrated that the risk for myocardial infarction is reduced by 80% among hemophilia A (HA) men compared to age and gender-matched controls. However, early atherosclerotic lesions were readily identified in small cohorts of adults HA and hemophilia B (HB) by ultrasonography of carotid and femoral arteries in a similar fashion to male controls. Here we sought to determine the role of FVIII and FIX on the development of atherosclerosis in two different mouse models. We compared a group of FVIII (HA) or FIX deficient mice (HB) lacking the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR\u2212/\u2212) or apolipoprotein E (apoE\u2212/\u2212) with hemostatically normal littermate controls lacking either LDLR (LDLR\u2212/\u2212) or apoE (apoE\u2212/\u2212). All mice were on C57Bl/6 background and all groups were matched for gender and age. When mice were 8 weeks old, they were placed on atherogenic diet. Analyzes of whole aortic (Sudan IV staining) or aortic sinus (Oil Red O) revealed that HA/apoE\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit less atherosclerotic lesions in a time-dependent manner. At weeks 22 (n=9) and 37 (n=9), the rate of atherosclerosis was 2-3-fold lower in HA/apoE when compared to age and gender-matched apoE (\u2212/\u2212) control group (p=0.001, and p&lt;0.001, respectively), but not at week 8. In contrast, no differences were noted in the rates of vascular lesions between HA/LDLR(\u2212/\u2212) (n=9) and controls (n=9) at all time points. Overall, HB/LDLR (\u2212/\u2212) developed atherosclerosis lesions at aortic sinus with similar rates as the controls at 8 and 22 weeks. However, at week 37, these mice exhibit more extensive tissue damage than the control (p=0.02). Surprisingly, the analyses of whole aorta revealed that atherosclerotic area was more wide-spread in FIX deficient mice in both models, i.e. HB/apoE(\u2212/\u2212) and HB/LDLR(\u2212/\u2212), compared to matched controls. At week 22, 16% and 11% (p=0.04) of the aorta (HB/LDLR[\u2212/\u2212] vs LDLR[\u2212/\u2212]) was covered by atherosclerosis, whereas the rates were 37% vs 21% (p=0.001) at week 37. Moreover, in the apoE(\u2212/\u2212) model the lack of FIX enhances the vascular lesions (14% vs 7%, p=0.02 at week 22) and (36% vs 22%, p=0.04 at week 37). In another model, we tested whether male transgenic (Tg+) mice for high levels of human FIX (\u223c 200% of activity above the normal) would influence the development of atherosclerotic lesions in the apoE(\u2212/\u2212) model. After 20 weeks, the rates of arterial vascular lesions were not different among Tg+FIX mice and controls after weeks 20 or 40 on atherogenic diet. In addition, Tg+FIX mice kept on regular chow diet up to 52 weeks showed no enhanced atherosclerosis but they presented high risk for venous thrombosis, as documented in 3/6 Tg+FIX mice and none of controls (0/6). These data demonstrate that coagulation activation in atherogenesis exhibits a rather heterogenous role in the disease evolution which suggest that clotting factors may have functions other than hemostasis in the development of vascular disease. Further studies in hemophilia B subjects are warranted to define the FIX effect on the onset and progression of occlusive vascular disease which may raises concerns on the onset cardiovascular risks on an aging hemophilia population.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Plant Science\", \"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [44, 39, 0], "string": "title={Formation of Stable Ustilago hordei Diploids}, container_title={International Journal of Plant Sciences}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Genetics\", \"Molecular Biology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [152, 0, 0], "string": "title={Development and high-throughput genotyping of substitution lines carring the chromosome segments of indica 9311 in the background of japonica Nipponbare}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [128, 0, 2088], "string": "title={Responsiveness of the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale to Monitor Clinical Recovery After Concussion or Mild Traumatic Brain Injury}, container_title={}, abstract={Background: The Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS) is used to assess the number and intensity of symptoms after a concussion/mild traumatic brain injury. However, its responsiveness to monitor clinical recovery has yet to be determined. Purpose: To evaluate the responsiveness of the PCSS to change and longitudinal validity in patients with persistent postconcussive symptoms as well as to explore the responsiveness of other clinical outcome measures to monitor recovery of physical symptoms in patients with persistent postconcussive symptoms. Study Design: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Patients with persistent symptoms after a concussion (N = 109) were evaluated using self-reported questionnaires at baseline and after a 6-week rehabilitation program. The program consisted of an individualized symptom-limited aerobic exercise program combined with education. Questionnaires included the PCSS, Neck Disability Index (NDI), Headache Disability Inventory (HDI), Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), and Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) related to 1) neck pain and 2) headache. Internal responsiveness was evaluated using the effect size (ES) and standardized response mean (SRM), and external responsiveness was determined with the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) calculated using a receiver operating characteristic curve. The global rating of change was used as the external criterion. Pearson correlations were used to determine the longitudinal validity. Results: The PCSS was highly responsive (ES and SRM, >1.3) and had an MCID of 26.5 points (of 132) for the total score and 5.5 (of 22) for the number of symptoms. For longitudinal validity, low to moderate correlations were found between changes in PCSS and changes in NDI, HDI, and DHI. The NDI, HDI, DHI, and NPRS were also highly responsive (ES and SRM, >0.8). Conclusion: All questionnaires including the PCSS were highly responsive and can be used with confidence by clinicians and researchers to evaluate change over time in a concussion population with persistent symptoms.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [129, 0, 0], "string": "title={Comparison of allografts and prosthetic valves when used for emergency aortic valve replacement for active infective endocarditis}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Immunology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [24, 0, 0], "string": "title={Dermatitis herpetiformis}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Political Science and International Relations\", \"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)\", \"Sociology and Political Science\"]", "language": "en", "length": [154, 0, 0], "string": "title={Malignant Growth: A Review of Financialisation in Crisis, Edited by Costas Lapavitsas, and The Restructuring of Capitalism in Our Time, by William K.

To counter this, this article amplifies the voices of Native American scholars and foregrounds a philosophical account of Indigenous naming. First, I explore some central characteristics of Indigenous ontology, epistemic virtue, and ethical responsibility, setting the stage for how Native naming draws these elements together into a complete, robust philosophy. Then I point toward leading but contingent principles of Native naming, foregrounding how Native names emerge from and create communities by situating (rather than individuating) the beings that they name within kinship structures, including human and nonhuman agents. Finally, I outline why and how Indigenous names and the knowledges they contain are crucial for both resisting settler violence and achieving environmental justice, not only for Native Americans, but

Yet little is known about the beliefs held by this age group. Our study offers some much needed insights into intersectionality around this group, by investigating how older workers\u2019 perceptions of supervisors performing a gendered leadership behavior are impacted by a supervisors\u2019 sex, age, and gendered attributes. The results show that these supervisors are perceived most favorably when they possess communal qualities and/or when they are depicted as being older than their direct reports.

requirements in uncertain and competitive global markets. Additive manufacturing machines are often described as \u201cflexible,\u201d but there is no detailed understanding of such flexibility in an operations management context. The purpose of this paper is to examine flexibility from a manufacturing systems perspective, demonstrating the different competencies that can be achieved and the factors that can inhibit these in commercial practice.Design/methodology/approachThis study extends existing flexibility theory in the context of an industrial additive manufacturing system through an investigation of 12 case studies, covering a range of sectors, product volumes, and technologies. Drawing upon multiple sources, this research takes a manufacturing systems perspective that recognizes the multitude of different resources that, together with individual industrial additive manufacturing machines, contribute to the satisfaction of demand.FindingsThe results show that the manufacturing system can achieve seven distinct internal flexibility competencies. This ability was shown to enable six out of seven external flexibility capabilities identified in the literature. Through a categorical assessment the extent to which each competency can be achieved is identified, supported by a detailed explanation of the enablers and inhibitors of flexibility for industrial additive manufacturing systems.Originality/valueAdditive manufacturing is widely expected to make an important contribution to future manufacturing, yet relevant management research is scant and the flexibility term is often ambiguously used. This research contributes the first detailed examination of flexibility for industrial additive manufacturing systems.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

The purpose of this article is to review literature already published pertaining to post-merger financial performance of acquirers. The review revealed that the research is mostly focused on the deals which took place in developed nations where M&A came into vogue as early as late nineteenth century.

We examined the hypothesis that the response of neutrophils to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is significantly altered in the presence of the endogenous mediator tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF). The data showed that human neutrophils pretreated with TNF for 10 to 30 min, displayed significantly enhanced superoxide production in response to LPS (from either Escherichia coli K-235 or E. coli 0127:B8), measured as lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence (CL), seen as an increase in the initial peak rate as well as the total CL accumulated over the incubation period. TNF amplified the response to LPS at 1 to 100 U of TNF/10 6 neutrophils and was able to enhance the response to a wide range of concentrations of LPS (0.01 to 1,000 ng/ml). The TNF-induced increase in the LPS response was paralleled by an increase in LPS binding to the neutrophils, which could be abrogated by an anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody. The results demonstrate that TNF significantly increases the LPS-induced release of oxygen radicals in neutrophils through the upregulation of cell surface CD14.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Electrical and Electronic Engineering\", \"Mechanical Engineering\", \"Control and Systems Engineering\"]", "language": "en", "length": [77, 0, 1278], "string": "title={A High Q-Factor Outer-Frame-Anchor Gyroscope Operating at First Resonant Mode}, container_title={}, abstract={Disc gyroscope manufactured through microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication processes becomes one of the most critical solutions for achieving high performance.

Numerical methods used to implement the continuous equation on a computer should be designed with the aim of preserving these favorable properties. The case of nonhyperbolic fixed points, which occur when the Hessian of the target function is the null matrix, requires further study. We prove that these nonhyperbolic interior fixed points are unstable in networks with three neurons and order two.

We shall see below by an elementary argument that this is not possible, and so, in a crude sense at least, random and generic extensions do not commute. This does not however rule out the possibility of a weaker commutativity. Let B be the complete Boolean algebra (in M) for adjoining a random real followed by a generic real and C be the complete Boolean algebra for adjoining a generic real followed by a random real. Then it still might be the case that B and C are isomorphic. This also fails, though, and we shall prove this by establishing the following combinatorial properties of MB and MC:butIn addition this will show that C cannot be embedded as a complete subalgebra of B.The property satisfied by B is reminiscent of calibre \u21351 [2]. B would have calibre if we could replace \u201cinfinite\u201d by \u201cuncountable\u201d, and this occurs if Martin's Axiom holds in M.

Faktor risiko tinggi dalam pengoperasian bandar udara perairan dan pesawat udara apung yang menyebabkan bandar udara perairan belum dapat berkembang sebanyak bandar udara konvensional. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk mengidentifikasi risiko dan memberikan rencana mitigasi risiko yang berpengaruh terhadap tingkat keselamatan dan keamanan operasi penerbangan pesawat udara apung (Seaplane) dan bandar udara perairan .Bandar udara perairan ini terletak di Kecamatan Maluk \u2013 Kab. Sumbawa Barat \u2013 Prov. Nusa Tenggara Barat. Analisis penilaian risiko menggunakan metode Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA). Metode ini dilakukan dengan cara brainstorming dan Focus Discussion Group (FGD) sehingga dapat diketahui derajat keparahan (Severity), kemungkinan kejadian (Occurrence), dan pendeteksian (Detection) sebuah risiko. Proses pengoperasian pesawat udara apung (Seaplane) dan bandar udara perairan mempunyai faktor risiko sebanyak 41(Empat Puluh Satu). Berdasarkan analisis yang telah dilaksanakan didapatkan nilai prioritas risiko RPN tertinggi sebesar 324 dengan faktor risiko terjadinya tabrakan pesawat udara apung (Seaplane) dengan paragliding/paralayang. Metode AHP digunakan untuk memilih prioritas mitigasi risiko yang akan digunakan dengan kriteria keuntungan (Benefit), pengeluaran (Cost), kesempatan (Opportunity), dan risiko (Risk). Dari hasil perhitungan metode AHP ini didapati prioritas mitigasi risiko tabrakan pesawat udara apung (Seaplane) dengan paragliding berturut-turut adalah Pihak Bandar Udara Perairan dan Operator

container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Myeloid Metaplasia with Myelofibrosis (MMM) is a Philadelphia negative chronic myeloproliferative disorder associated with myeloid metaplasia in the spleen and liver, bone marrow fibrosis and neoangiogenesis. The myeloproliferation is characterized by an increased number of circulating CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors (up to 200 folds) with a prominent amplification of dystrophic megakaryocytes (Mk). Alteration of tyrosine kinase signals is suspected to play a key role in the myeloproliferation and in the increased sensitivity of hematopoietic progenitors to growth factors. Glivec is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the ABL fusion gene, platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB) and SCF receptor (c-kit). In this study, we investigated the effect of Glivec/STI571 on the megakaryopoiesis and the kinase expression of 11 MMM patients enrolled in a European EUMNET clinical trial. We showed that 50 percents of the treated patients exhibited a tendency to a decrease in the CD34+ cell number from 261/\u03bcL to 56/\u03bcL with a normalization of the CD34+ cell count (1\u201310/\u03bcL) in 20 percents of these patients (2/10). We also observed a reduction of a CD34+CD41+ Mk subpopulation co-expressing the CD9 tetraspanin that is suggested to be a marker of MMM. Normalization of the CD9 gene expression level was further confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR in MMM mononuclear cells. In contrast, 55 percents of MMM patients (5/9 patients) showed an increase in their platelet count from 191 x 109/L to 282 x 109/L during treatment with Glivec. Interestingly, an increase in the platelet count was also observed in three of the five thrombopenic patients who exhibited an increase greater than 50 x 109/L (p= 0.02) being associated with an augmentation in the number of clonogenic megakaryocytic progenitors (CFU-Mk). The effect of Glivec treatment on megakaryopoiesis was further illustrated by a morphometric analysis on bone marrow histological sections showing a normalization of the size and shape of the dystrophic MMM Mk. We also analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR the effect of Glivec treatment on receptor kinase gene expression in circulating mononuclear cells from MMM patients and demonstrated a normalization of the receptor beta of the PDGF, a cytokine involved in Mk differentiation. Actually, the PDGFB expression that was down-regulated in MMM PBMC before Glivec as compared to normal PBMC (\u22121.14 +/\u2212 0.76 and \u2212 0.14 +/\u2212 0.42, respectively; p= 0.02) was significantly increased during therapy, reaching a normal level in 60% of tested patients. In conclusion, our results show that Glivec treatment reduced the CD34+ cell number and stimulated the megakaryopoiesis of MMM thrombopenic patients, probably by restoring Mk progenitor differentiation.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Philosophy\"]", "language": "en", "length": [26, 0, 0], "string": "title={IV.\u2014ANTAGONISTIC REACTIONS}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Earth-Surface Processes\", \"Geography, Planning and Development\"]", "language": "fr", "length": [42, 26, 0], "string": "title={La neige dans les Alpes fran\u00e7aises du Nord}, container_title={Revue de g\u00e9ographie alpine}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis\", \"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health\", \"Pollution\"]", "language": "en", "length": [80, 31, 2039], "string": "title={Municipal Solid Waste Disposal Operational Performance in Wa Municipality, Ghana}, container_title={Journal of Health and Pollution}, abstract={Background. The generation and management of solid waste pose potential adverse impacts on human health and the environment. Objective. The present study examines the operational performance of municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal in the Wa Municipality, Ghana. Methods. The study applied both qualitative and quantitative research methods and modelled the Wa Municipality's MSW disposal system using the municipal solid waste decision support tool (MSW DST). Acid gases (sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides) and total particulate matter that have a direct impact on human health were set as the objective functions for modelling five MSW disposal scenarios. The modelled scenarios were: 1) landfill disposal only; 2) composting and landfill disposal; 3) composting, incineration, refuse derived fuels (RDF) and landfill disposal; 4) separation, composting, incineration, RDF and landfill disposal; and 5) separation, transfer, material recovery, composting, incineration, RDF and landfill disposal. The pollutants chosen as indicators for substance flow analysis included lead, cadmium, arsenic, mercury, copper, chromium, and zinc. Results. Scenarios 4 and 5 produced the least engineering cost of 1 150 000 US $/year for the entire MSW disposal system, whereas scenario 2 produced the highest cost of 1 340 000 US $/year. Scenario 5 produced the least average health impacts of \u22125.812E-04 lbs/year, while scenario 2 generated the highest engineering cost and produced the highest average health impact of 9.358E-05 lbs/year. Scenarios 5 and 4, which included waste-to-energy conversion in the systems, produced the lowest average health impacts (\u22125.812E-04 lbs/year and \u22125.611E-04 lbs/year, respectively). Conclusions. The adoption of an integrated solid waste management concept, including waste-to-energy technologies, will not only help to lessen MSW disposal hazards, but also to produce alternative sources of energy for Ghana and other developing countries.

Mature t-tubule networks are found in mammalian ventricular cardiomyocytes, with the transverse components of t-tubules occurring near sarcomeric z-discs. Cardiac t-tubules contain membrane microdomains enriched with ion channels and signaling molecules. The microdomains serve as key signaling hubs in regulation of cardiomyocyte function. Dyad microdomains formed at the junctional contact between t-tubule membrane and neighboring sarcoplasmic reticulum are critical in calcium signaling and excitation-contraction coupling necessary for beat-to-beat heart contraction. In this review, we provide an overview of the current knowledge in gross morphology and structure, membrane and protein composition, and function of the cardiac t-tubule network. We also review in detail current knowledge on the formation of functional membrane subdomains within t-tubules, with a particular focus on the cardiac dyad microdomain. Lastly, we discuss the dynamic nature of t-tubules including membrane turnover, trafficking of transmembrane proteins, and the life cycles of membrane subdomains such as the cardiac BIN1-microdomain, as well as t-tubule remodeling and alteration in diseased hearts. Understanding cardiac t-tubule biology in normal and failing hearts is providing novel diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities to better treat patients with failing hearts.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Urban Studies\", \"Geography, Planning and Development\"]", "language": "fr", "length": [92, 0, 0], "string": "title={La coop\u00e9ration transfrontali\u00e8re institutionnelle : outils d\u2019analyse et d\u00e9marche scientifique}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Obstetrics and Gynecology\", \"Rehabilitation\", \"Reproductive Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [173, 0, 0], "string": "title={Investigation of the infertile couple: a basic fertility work-up performed within 12 months of trying to conceive generates costs and complications for no particular benefit}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering\", \"Materials Science (miscellaneous)\", \"Business and International Management\"]", "language": "pt", "length": [76, 0, 1090], "string": "title={A Sociologia de Roberto Campos e a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de uma ordem liberal no Brasil}, container_title={}, abstract={Resumo: Este artigo tem como objeto o ide\u00e1rio social do diplomata, economista e pol\u00edtico Roberto Campos (1917-2001).

The variability of phenological and morphological characters has a strong genetic determinism, in correlation with the evolution of pedoclimatic conditions. In the context of climatic changes, it has been essential to understand the mechanism of interaction between the genes involved in manifesting characters and traits responsible for the adaptability and productivity of the variety and the environmental conditions. The evaluation was carried out on 100 trees (4 trees/genotype), analyzing 3,000 leaves of leaves, fruits, shoots and flowers, the working volume being over 15,000 measurements and observations. Plum is a vigorous or semi-vigorous species, but 'Centenar' and 'Zamfira' show a fairly clear difference in vigor compared to the other varieties, and this can be an advantage for these varieties when used in high-density orchards.

conservation-welfare nexus in reintroduction programmes: a role for sensory ecology}, container_title={}, abstract={AbstractSince reintroduction programmes involve moving animals from captive or wild environments and releasing them into novel environments, there are sure to be a number of challenges to the welfare of the individuals involved. Behavioural theory can help us develop reintroductions that are better for both the welfare of the individual and the conservation of populations. In addition to modifying captive environments to prepare animals for release to the wild, it is possible to modify the animals\u2019 experience in the post-release environment. For releases to be more successful, they need to better accommodate the ecological and psychological needs of individuals. A better understanding of sensory ecology \u2014 how animals acquire and respond to information in their environment \u2014 is needed to develop new, more successful management strategies for reintroductions. Sensory ecology integrates ecological and psychological processes, calling for better synergy among researchers with divergent backgrounds in conservation and animal welfare science. This integrative approach leads to new topics of investigation in reintroduction biology, including more careful consideration of post-release stress and the role of social support. Reintroductions are essentially exercises in \u2018forced\u2019 dispersal; thus, an especially promising avenue of research is the role of proximate mechanisms governing dispersal and habitat selection decisions.

Observing the above-mentioned training sets, we find that \u201csentence comprehension\u201d is more important than \u201cword comprehension\u201d in multiple-choice task, and therefore we propose sentence-level neural network models. Our model firstly uses LSTM network and a composition model to learn compositional vector representation for sentences and then trains a sentence-level attention model for obtaining the sentence-level attention between the sentence embedding in documents and the optional sentences embedding by dot product. Finally, a consensus attention is gained by merging individual attention with the merging function.

nematodes during the first 3-years after reclamation of a brown coal mining area. Samples were taken from 5 fields: 1 year before excavation, right at the beginning of reclamation (Yr 0), and in fields 1, 2 and 3 years after reclamation. A total of 31 families of nematodes were recorded and the nematode community of field Yr 0 was significantly different from that of other four sampling sites. Nematode abundance decreased after excavation and then began to return to initial community levels at each of the three reclamation sites with bacterivore nematodes recovering faster than the fungivores, omnivore-predators or the plant parasites. A gradual but consistent regeneration of the nematode community to its original structure was seen from the beginning of sampling and this recovery process was detectable over the three successive years of experimentation. Open-pit mining, therefore, drastically disturbed nematode community structure initially but the community was able to recover and stabilized quickly after reclamation.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0,

HL-60 cells increases the expression of a single lysophospholipase}, container_title={}, abstract={Treatment of HL-60 cells with 0.5 mM-butyric acid resulted in morphological changes, including the formation of cytoplasmic granules, nuclear condensation and segmentation. These differentiated cells had an elevated phospholipase A2 activity and an increased capacity to synthesize a variety of eicosanoids, including both lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase products. Phospholipase A2-mediated release of arachidonic acid is accompanied by an equimolar production of potentially cytotoxic lysophospholipid. In association with the differentiation process, there was a 2-3-fold increase in lysophospholipase activity. Subsequent studies were undertaken to identify and characterize the lysophospholipases in this cell system, with 1-[1-14C]palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine as substrate. Hydrophobic chromatography of both undifferentiated and differentiated cell extracts revealed three peaks of enzyme activity. Extracts of differentiated cells contained a dramatic increase in activity contained in peak 2. The increase in enzymic activity of peak 2 appeared to account for the increase in total lysophospholipase activity found in the differentiated cell homogenates. The lysophospholipases contained in peaks 2 and 3 were purified to homogeneity and were 20 and 22 kDa respectively, as determined by denaturing polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. Peaks 2 and 3 were similar on the basis of amino acid composition, but had distinctive C-terminal peptide amino acid sequences. Enzymic characterization of these proteins demonstrated that there was no detectable level of non-specific esterase, acyltransferase or transacylase activity associated with these proteins. We concluded that peak 2 lysophospholipase is regulated by differentiation in HL-60 cells and may play an important role in protecting these cells from the cytolytic effects of the lysophospholipids produced by the activation of phospholipase A2.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Geriatrics and Gerontology\", \"Gerontology\", \"Rehabilitation\", \"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation\"]", "language": "en", "length": [98, 38, 0], "string": "title={Validation of the Timed Up and Go Test for Assessing Balance Variables in Adults Aged 65 and Older}, container_title={Journal of Aging and Physical Activity}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine\", \"Surgery\"]", "language": "en", "length": [88, 0, 0], "string": "title={Clinical characteristics and treatment of spinal cord injury in children and adolescents}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Archeology\", \"Archeology\", \"Conservation\"]", "language": "en", "length": [100, 0, 0], "string": "title={Early Medieval Britain: the rebirth of towns in the post-roman west.

administered over a 10-year period to graduate-level psychology students in an advanced methodology seminar, to explore one of the central questions of qualitative research: What theories about identity do we bring to our analyses of first-person interview narratives? It suggests that researchers\u2019 interpretations of what appear to be inconsistent and/or conflicting statements by interview subjects about their experience within the course of an interview can serve as a conceptual touchstone reflecting core assumptions about identity. Students\u2019 responses to the exercise, which asked them to interpret two statements by an interview subject that seem to self-contradict, have consistently favored the type of dichotomous analytical paradigms associated with modernist conceptions of a unified self. This trend may be reflective of an insufficiently developed interpretive lexicon within postmodern narrative analysis.

The resulting \"hot-QC\" formulation is a partitioned domain multiscale method in which atomistic regions modeled via molecular dynamics coexist with surrounding continuum regions. Hot-QC can be used to study equilibrium properties of systems under constant or quasistatic loading conditions. Two variants of the method are presented which differ in how continuum regions are evolved. In \"hot-QC-static\" the free energy of the continuum is minimized at each step as the atomistic region evolves dynamically. In \"hot-QC-dynamic\" both the atomistic and continuum regions evolve dynamically in tandem. The latter approach is computationally more efficient, but introduces an anomalous \u201cmesh entropy\" which must be corrected.

abstract={Abstract Purpose: Alcohol use is causally linked to multiple cancer sites. We present global, regional and national estimates of alcohol-attributable cancer burden in 2020 to inform alcohol policy and cancer control across different settings globally. Methods: In this population-based study, we calculated population attributable fractions (PAFs) using relative risk estimates and alcohol use prevalence by age, sex, and country. Assuming a 10-year latency period between alcohol consumption and cancer occurrence, we used alcohol consumption prevalence from 2010 and GLOBOCAN 2020 data to estimate new cancer cases attributable to alcohol consumption. We also calculated the contribution of moderate (&lt;20 g alcohol per day), risky (20 to 60 g per day), and heavy (&gt;60 g per day) drinking to the total alcohol-attributable cancer burden. Results: Globally, an estimated 702 900, or 3.9%, of all new cases of cancer in 2020 were attributable to alcohol consumption. Males represented 71.1% of the total alcohol-attributable cancer cases. The cancer sites which contributed the most alcohol-attributable cases were cancers of the esophagus (183 000 cases), liver (142 600 cases), and breast (114 300 cases). PAFs were lowest in Northern Africa and Western Asia (less than 1%) in both sexes, and highest in Eastern Asia (7.7%) and Central and Eastern Europe (6.9%) in men, and in Central and Eastern Europe (3.8%), Western Europe (3.5%) and Australia and New Zealand (3.55%) in women. Risky and heavy drinking contributed most to the burden of alcohol-attributable cancers (42.6% and 42.5%, respectively), and moderate drinking contributed 14.9%. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the need for effective policy and interventions to increase awareness of cancer risks associated with alcohol use and decrease overall alcohol consumption to avoid future rises in alcohol-attributable cancer burden in several regions of the world.

Resistance in Aedes aegypti Varies Seasonally and Geographically in Texas/Mexico Border Cities}, container_title={}, abstract={ABSTRACT Insecticide use is the primary method of attempting to reduce or control the spread of mosquito-borne diseases. Insecticide resistance is a major concern as resistance will limit the efficacy of vector-control efforts. The lower Rio Grande Valley region of South Texas has had autochthonous transmission of multiple mosquito-borne diseases including those caused by dengue virus, chikungunya virus, and Zika virus. However, the current status of mosquito resistance to commonly used pesticides in this region is unknown. In this study, we collected field samples from multiple municipalities in South Texas and assessed resistance using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bottle bioassay. All populations exhibited characteristics of resistance, and permethrin was the most effective insecticide with an average mortality rate of 44.78%. Deltamethrin and sumethrin had significantly lower mortality rates of 20.31% and 32.16%, respectively, although neither of these insecticides are commonly used for vector-control activities in this region. Depending on which insecticide was used, there was little significance between each of the 7 cities. Seasonal variation in resistance was observed among the collection sites. Both deltamethrin and sumethrin exhibited an increase in susceptibility over the course of 10 months, while permethrin exhibited a decrease in susceptibility. These data highlight the need for further studies to determine if variations in resistance observed are repeated. The data and future findings may be useful in determining the most effective strategies for pesticide use and rotation.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

omega-3 fatty acid in the Western human diet. Currently, the source of omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) is mainly dependent on wild fisheries, making this resource unsustainable in the foreseeable future. In recent years, a high rate of biosynthesis and accumulation of DHA has been discovered in a freshwater species (Chirostoma estor) belonging to the Atherinopsidae family. Interest in evaluating fatty acid composition in other members of the family has emerged, so this study compiles original data of flesh composition of eight atherinopsid species from freshwater and brackish environments, either wild or cultured. High levels of DHA (16 to 31%) were found in all analyzed members of the family, except in C. grandocule, independently of their habitat or origin. The analyzed species of the Jordani group (C. estor, C. promelas and C. humboldtianum) showed high DHA and low EPA levels (}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

The purpose of this study was to assess the less understood effect of Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) on the replication and immune responses of NDV in broiler chicken. Three-week-old commercial broiler chickens were inoculated with either NDV, MG or both etiological agents. The experimental groups were identified as follows: negative control (Group C), Mycoplasma challenged (Group M), NDV challenged (Group V) and virus and Mycoplasma challenged (Group V+M). Blood samples and swabs were collected on daily basis for two weeks. All infected birds showed positive results for NDV shedding, however, the pattern of virus shedding was different, with birds of the group V+M showing more pronounced virus shedding than the birds in the group V. In addition, birds of V+M group showed significant reduction in anti-AI antibody responses and interferon gene expression than the birds in the V group.

Here, we used human neuroblastoma cell lines with inducible TrkA/NTRK1 expression to mechanistically explore the role of TrkA/NTRK1 signaling in checkpoint activation after DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation (IR). TrkA/NTRK1 activated cells showed increased short-term cell viability upon IR compared to vector control cells. This was accompanied by a deficient G2/M-checkpoint at both low (1 Gy) and high doses (4 Gy) of IR. In a tightly controlled setting, we confirmed that this effect was strictly dependent on activation of TrkA/NTRK1 by its ligand, nerve growth factor (NGF). TrkA/NTRK1-expressing cells displayed impaired ATM and CHK1 phosphorylation, resulting in stabilization of CDC25B.

is a turbidite sequence whose environment of deposition has been a matter of debate. Interpretations vary with different authors between lacustrine or brackish to coastal marine. It is possibly of estuarine origin. Its total stratigraphic thickness of 117 m has been divided into eight lithostratigraphic units on the basis of vertical changes in sands tone: shale ratio. A lacustrine setting is feasible in view of the association with fluvial formations below (Fleurant Formation) and above (Bonaventure Formation), although these are separated by a disconformity or an angular unconformity from the Escuminac. The lack of any shelly marine invertebrate fauna is negative evidence indirectly favoring a lacustrine origin. Periodically stagnant bottom-water conditions evidenced by the preservation of laminites are compatible with a lake environment. The fossil fish fauna, however, contains elements which point toward brackish or marine environments. Geochemical evidence also seems to support brackish conditions, although it is not clear to what extent the geochemical signature may have been inherited from older marine detrital clays. A silled estuary would best accommodate the different lines of evidence, but poses problems of fitting into the broadscale paleogcographic picture of the Upper Devonian Old Red Continent.

abstract={3582 Background: Apomab, a fully human affinity-matured IgG1 monoclonal antibody, is a DR5 pro-apoptotic receptor agonist that triggers the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. DR5 is expressed both on malignant and normal cells; however, pre-clinical data indicate that DR5 activation stimulates apoptosis predominantly in malignant cells. This first-in-human study assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and any early evidence of anti-cancer efficacy of Apomab. Methods: Patients with advanced treatment-refractory solid tumors received Apomab IV on Day1 (cycle 1 = 28 days, cycles 2\u20138 = 14 days) at 1, 4, 10, 15, or 20 mg/kg (stage 1); with cohort expansion at 10 mg/kg or the MTD (if lower) every 14 days (stage 2). Tumor assessments were made after 2, 4 and 8 cycles. Therapy continued past 2 cycles as permitted by on-going evidence of benefit, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Results: 26 patients ECOG PS \u00e2\u2030\u00a41 have been enrolled and treated through 20 mg/kg. The 20 (8M, 12F) with confirmed data (up to 15mg/kg) received a median of 2 cycles (range 1\u20138). All dose levels have been tolerable (4 mg/kg are greater than those displaying activity in preclinical models. No HAHA responses have been seen to date. Conclusions: Apomab is well tolerated with a minor response seen in a colorectal cancer patient. Enrollment is continuing at 10mg/kg. Further safety and efficacy data will be presented.

However, research as to how consumer trust can be built in an online environment is limited and varies considerably in terms of the dimensions of the problem that are examined. Consequently, much of our understanding of the antecedents of trust in online shopping context remains fragmented. This study uses a previously validated measurement instrument to investigate, in an Irish context, the existence and importance of specific perceptions and factors that are thought to predict the generation of consumer trust in Internet shopping. The research results provide evidence that Irish consumers\u2019 perception of vendor trustworthiness is the result of specific factors that it is possible for vendors to manage.

However, therapeutic approaches using ACT in patients with solid tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), has not shown substantially improved clinical outcomes in particular due to immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments. Therefore, strategies to enhance ACT T cell functionality in vivo and to overcome the immunosuppressive microenvironments in solid tumors are strongly needed. We developed a strategy combining nanomedicine with ACT, based on the chemical conjugation of cytokine-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) as synthetic \u201cbackpacks\u201d to the surfaces of live lymphocytes for adoptive therapy. Novel protein nanoparticles were synthesized by crosslinking of single chain IL-12 (scIL-12)- or IL-15 superagonist through disulfide-containing crosslinkers, forming nanogels that when bound to the surface of T cells, release the supporting cytokines in response to antigen receptor signaling-mediated changes in cell surface redox state. This TCR-mediated drug release allowed drug delivery to the T cells to be focused in tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes. Coupling of cytokine nanogels to T cell membranes induced significant cell activation in terms of interferon-\u03b3 production or proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells \u201cbackpacked\u201d with scIL-12 or IL-15SA nanogels were capable of substantial tumor cell killing in a B16F10 melanoma cancer model in vivo, while avoiding lethal systemic toxicities triggered by systemically-administered immunomodulatory cytokines. Ongoing studies are seeking to apply this approach in HCC, and this approach bears the potential for the development of successful immunotherapeutic strategies against this and other solid tumors where effective treatment options are still lacking.

Methods: Human breast cancer MCF-7 cells were treated with the topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan at 1 \u03bcM or vehicle for 1 h, and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Staining with gamma-H2AX antibody was performed on sections of treated MCF-7 cells, tumor specimens, and biopsies at baseline and after doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy from cancer patients. Numbers of foci and level of gamma-H2AX expression per tumor nucleus were determined by manual counting under a light microscope and an Automated Cellular Imaging System. Results: There was a rise in the mean numbers of nuclear foci and intensity of gamma-H2AX in MCF-7 cells treated with irinotecan versus vehicle (19.9 \u00b1 2.7 vs. 9.95 \u00b1 3.6; P No significant

This article examines various aspects of their work, focusing specifically on the employment of the classical form in Shaw's Saint Joan and Heaney's The Burial at Thebes. Since the essential action in Greek drama relies on discourse and verbal interaction, its form appealed to both Shaw and Heaney, who are remembered today as masters of the spoken word. This article shows that their use of classical forms and themes sheds light on the power politics of their respective times. While the two plays significantly differ, one being a bona fide history play and the other an adaptation of the famous classic, their authors share a common focal point: they want to cure humanity of a disease whose main symptom is the repetition of History's mistakes.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

The study therefore assessed the association between knowledge and practices in terms of Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference (WC) among 500 diagnosed T2 DM using a cross-sectional design. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used for assessing their knowledge. The mean knowledge score of the patients was 15.29 \u00b1 3.6. A significant negative association was found between the knowledge score and the HbA1c level. Age was positively associated with HbA1c and WC. Duration of DM was positively and education was negatively associated with HbA1c. Gender was negatively associated with BMI while income was positively associated with BMI and WC. All the associations were significant. The diagnosed T2 DM patients are deficient of sufficient knowledge; the knowledge score and HbA1c have a significant negative relationship, not other actions.

We initially construct an adaptive time-varying weight mechanism for a combination forecast. To compare the predictive power of the models, we take the SPA test, which uses bootstrap as the evaluation criterion and employs the rolling window strategy for out-of-sample forecasting. The empirical study shows that the non-parametric TVF model forecasts more accurately than the HAR-RV model. In addition, the average combination forecast model does not have a significant advantage over any single model while our adaptive combination model does.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

container_title={}, abstract={Smallholder farmer and tribal communities are often characterised as marginalised and highly vulnerable to emerging zoonotic diseases due to their relatively poor access to healthcare, worse-off health outcomes, proximity to sources of disease risks, and their social and livelihood organisation. Yet, access to relevant and timely disease information that could strengthen their adaptive capacity remain challenging and poorly characterised in the empirical literature. This paper addresses this gap by exploring the role of disease information in shaping the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmer and tribal groups to Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), a tick-borne viral haemorrhagic fever. We carried out household surveys (n = 229) and in-depth interviews (n = 25) in two affected districts\u2013Shimoga and Wayanad\u2013in the Western Ghats region. Our findings suggest that, despite the generally limited awareness about KFD, access to disease information improved households\u2019 propensity to implement adaptation strategies relative to households that had no access to it. Of the variety of adaptation strategies implemented, vaccination, avoiding forest visits, wearing of protective clothing and footwear, application of dimethyl phthalate (DMP) oil and income diversification were identified by respondents as important adaptive measures during the outbreak seasons. Even so, we identified significant differences between individuals in exposure to disease information and its contribution to substantive adaptive action. Households reported several barriers to implement adaptation strategies including, lack of disease information, low efficacy of existing vaccine, distrust, religio-cultural sentiments, and livelihood concerns. We also found that informal information sharing presented a promising avenue from a health extension perspective albeit with trade-offs with potential distortion of the messages through misinformation and/or reporting bias. Altogether, our findings stress the importance of contextualising disease information and implementing interventions in a participatory way that sufficiently addresses the social determinants of health in order to bolster households\u2019 adaptive capacity to KFD and other neglected endemic zoonoses.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

However, a reliable predictor of treatment response has not been established. Patients who experienced immune-related adverse events (irAEs) of any grade yielded a significantly higher response rate than did those did not experience irAEs. Methods: Three cases of advanced HCC with or without previous sorafenib treatment, underwent anti-PD-1 treatment (pembrolizumab, 2 mg/kg, at 3-week interval) with or without combination of sorafenib (400mg daily). Results: Case 1 Fever (38.3\u00b0C) developed 2 days after anti-PD-1 treatment. The fever persisted for 2 months and gradually subsided (Figure 2B). Follow-up computed tomography (CT) revealed persistent tumor shrinkage and complete response at the latest time of examination (Figure 1B); the treatment is ongoing. Case 2 Spiking fever developed after each time of anti-PD-1 treatment. Follow-up CT revealed a remarkable decrease in the tumor size (3 cm), resulting in a partial response (Figure 1D); the treatment is ongoing. Case 3 Twelve days after the treatment, the patient complained of fever and general weakness. Laboratory data revealed tumor lysis syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). HBV, hepatitis B virus; HCV, hepatitis C virus; BCLC, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer; AFP, alpha-fetoprotein; TACE, transarterial chemoembolization; CR, complete response; PR, partial response. Conclusions: Fever may be an early predictor of response to anti-PD-1 treatment. The degree of fever seemed to be correlated with tumor burden. High fever may suggest cytokine storm and possible tumor lysis syndrome. Early detection is necessary for the immediate prescription of steroids and management of tumor lysis.[Table: see text]}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

species of Darwin\u2019s finches. Control methods are under development, but key information is missing about the reproductive biology of P. downsi and the behavior of flies in and near nests of their hosts. We used external and internal nest cameras to record the behavior of P. downsi adults within and outside nests of the Galapagos Flycatcher, Myiarchus magnirostris, throughout all stages of the nesting cycle. These recordings showed that P. downsi visited flycatcher nests throughout the day with higher fly activity during the nestling phase during vespertine hours. The observations also revealed that multiple P. downsi individuals can visit nests concurrently, and that there are some interactions among these flies within the nest. Fly visitation to nests occurred significantly more often while parent birds were away from the nest than in the nest, and this timing appears to be a strategy to avoid predation by parent birds. We report fly mating behavior outside the nest but not in the nest cavity. We discuss the relevance of these findings for the adaptive forces shaping P. downsi life history strategies as well as rearing and control measures.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0,

sanctions\u2019 has witnessed some subtle changes\u2014in particular, its endeavour to build a rule-of-law-based unilateral sanctions regime. Both international law and the domestic law of China provide for its unilateral sanctions. It is within the discretion of China to take unilateral sanctions as long as it is not against its obligation under the applicable international law, but its domestic law shows a certain level of insufficiency. The administrative nature of unilateral sanctions decides the core parameter of due process for a rule-of-law-based unilateral sanctions regime, which has its boundaries: the limit of law as a regulatory regime for unilateral sanctions as political instrument and the limit of domestic jurisdiction in terms of extraterritorial application. To upgrade the unilateral sanctions regime according to its own concept of rule of law in foreign relations, China needs to improve the compatibility among current laws and to provide proper remedies.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

refer\u00eancia o conceito de cuidado infantil. Tomado como express\u00e3o das formas que hist\u00f3rica e culturalmente assume a rela\u00e7\u00e3o adulto / crian\u00e7a, o cuidado infantil pode ser definido, hoje, neste n\u00edvel de ensino, como uma atua\u00e7\u00e3o do professor ou professora sobre aspectos extracognitivos do desenvolvimento de seus alunos, o que exige uma postura de envolvimento afetivo e compromisso com as crian\u00e7as. Por meio de um estudo de caso de enfoque etnogr\u00e1fico, discute-se a presen\u00e7a do cuidado nos ideais e pr\u00e1ticas pedag\u00f3gicas de Alda, uma professora que n\u00e3o realizava plenamente essas prescri\u00e7\u00f5es. Trata-se, nesse sentido, de uma aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o que permite revelar os limites de abordagens essencialistas, em que est\u00e3o relacionados, linearmente, a feminilidade e aqueles ideais de professora. De um lado, acentua-se, aqui, o sentido plural das diversas formas de feminilidade, suas articula\u00e7\u00f5es com rela\u00e7\u00f5es de classe e ra\u00e7a; e, de outro lado, indica-se que as prescri\u00e7\u00f5es de cuidado fazem parte de uma cultura escolar, produzida e reproduzida na pr\u00f3pria institui\u00e7\u00e3o, mais do que em formas espec\u00edficas de socializa\u00e7\u00e3o feminina. A hist\u00f3ria de Alda indica a necessidade de discutir o racismo no interior das escolas, a come\u00e7ar do pr\u00f3prio corpo docente. E mostra que, se estamos convencidos da relev\u00e2ncia das pr\u00e1ticas de cuidado para o ensino, \u00e9 preciso traz\u00ea-las, criticamente, ao primeiro plano nas discuss\u00f5es pedag\u00f3gicas,

chlorophyll absorbance peak or that for anthocyanin, has been used to determine the fruit ripening of several fruit species using portable devices such as Standard DA-Meter\u00ae and Kiwi-Meter\u00ae. In this study, for the first time, the application of the IAD was evaluated on single, intact olives of the Leccino cultivar, as a single non-destructive maturity index to follow ripening in the field, directly on the tree. The IAD determined by both devices was found to be useful for monitoring the olive ripening, however, better performance was achieved with the Kiwi-Meter\u00ae. In fact, the IAD determined by this device was more effective at measuring all the studied olive ripening parameters in the calibration and validation datasets with acceptable accuracy. Specifically, better performance of the IDA by Kiwi-Meter\u00ae was observed in estimation of the color index (R2 = 0.817, DRMSEC = 0.404 and RPIQ = 3.863 for calibration and R2 = 0.752, DRMSECV = 0.574 and RPIQ = 3.244 for validation), confirming its potential for evaluating the degree of olive ripeness. This novel index has significant applicative possibilities, since it would allow rapid, on-site screening of the best harvesting time to improve the olive production in terms of both yield and

Die Frage, inwiefern Verletzungen dieser beiden Strukturen zur Instabilit\u00e4t und einer m\u00f6glichen Verengung des Spinalkanals beitragen, ist nur unzureichend gekl\u00e4rt. Ziel unserer Untersuchung war daher die biomechanische Analyse der Weite des Spinalkanals und der Dislokation des Dens axis in Abh\u00e4ngigkeit von Verletzungen der o. g. Strukturen. Material und Methode An 10 frischen Humanpr\u00e4paraten wurde unter Fluoroskopie eine physiologische Flexion und Extension im intakten Zustand sowie bei Densfraktur und nach Ruptur des Lig. transversum simuliert. Mittels Fluoroskopie wurden der Durchmesser des Spinalkanals und die Frakturdislokation gemessen. Ergebnisse Im intakten Zustand wurde in Neutralposition die Weite des Spinalkanals mit 19,8 \u00b1 1,7 mm bemessen. In Flexion wurden 19,5 \u00b1 1,8 mm und in Extension 19,8 \u00b1 1,8 mm gemessen. Nach Frakturierung betrugen die Werte 18,5/18,9/17,9 mm, nach additiver Ligamentruptur 20,3/19,4/22,6 mm. In der 2. Gruppe zeigten sich bei Ligamentruptur Werte von 18,6/16,2/17,3 mm und nach zus\u00e4tzlicher Fraktur 16,6/14,1/18,7 mm. Die Dislokation der Fraktur wurde bei alleiniger Fraktur mit 2,2/2,5/2,5 mm und nach zus\u00e4tzlicher Ligamentruptur mit 2,6/2,2/2,2 mm bestimmt. In der Gruppe, bei der zuerst die Ligamentruptur erfolgte, zeigten sich nach Fraktur Werte von 1,5/1,9/3,5 mm. Schlussfolgerung Bereits ab einer Verengung des Spinalkanals von 2,0 mm werden neurologische Ausf\u00e4lle beobachtet. In Relation zu den eigenen Ergebnissen zeigt sich, dass sowohl isolierte als auch kombinierte Verletzungen zu einer relevanten Verengung f\u00fchren k\u00f6nnen.

The results show that the petroleum hydrocarbon composition in the oily sludge and contaminated soils was spatially variable. Highly toxic petroleum hydrocarbon species such as BTEX and PAHs were generally lacking, and both sludge- and soil-borne hydrocarbons were dominated by long-chain petroleum hydrocarbons. The soil contamination depth was generally very shallow although localized deep profiles (>0.5 m) were found. A loose relationship was established between TPH in the sludge and that in the underlying soil. On average, the soil had a greater percentage of shorter-chain hydrocarbon fractions (either aliphatics or aromatics), as compared to the sludge. The environmental risk from the oily sludge and contaminated soils is considered to be relatively low. For cost-effective management of the environmental risk of decommissioning an oilfield waste pit, containment of the sludge and contaminated soils using a soil-capping approach may be sufficient to minimize the possible adverse environmental impacts from the decommissioned waste pit, and this may represent an option that is superior to other costly remediation strategies.}",

We surveyed the two populations and estimated them to comprise 1,985 and 29 individuals on Maria Major and Minor, respectively. The Maria Minor population is currently at a critically low level and consequently highly susceptible to demographic and genetic stochasticity and catastrophic events, in particular the colonization of invasive mammalian predators.

Prolonged exposure to lead will induce oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in the kidneys, which in turn causes kidney injury. Lycium barbarum polysaccharide (LBP) is well known for its numerous pharmacological properties. This study aims to explore the efficacy and mechanism of LBP against lead-induced kidney damage in mice. Symptoms of renal injury were induced in mice by using 25 mg/kg lead acetate (PbAc2), and different doses of LBP (200, 400, and 600 mg/kg BW) were orally administrated to PbAc2-treated mice for five weeks. The results of the pharmacodynamics experiment showed that the renal pathological damages, serum creatinine (Cre), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and kidney index of PbAc2-treated mice could be significantly alleviated by treatment with LBP. Further, LBP treatment significantly increased the weight and feed intake of PbAc2-treated mice. The dose effect results indicated that a medium dose of LBP was superior to high and low doses. The results of mechanistic experiments showed that LBP could attenuate oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in the kidneys of mice with lead toxicity by activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Energy Engineering and Power Technology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [51, 30, 0], "string": "title={Aspects Regarding the Use of Modeling in Accounting}, container_title={Procedia Economics and Finance}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Electrical and Electronic Engineering\", \"Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design\", \"Software\"]", "language": "en", "length": [28, 0, 0], "string": "title={Crosstalk reduction for VLSI}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Marketing\", \"Strategy and Management\", \"Computer Science Applications\"]", "language": "en", "length": [102, 0, 0], "string": "title={Applying smarter commerce analysis for click and mortar of integration platform in the retail industry}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Religious Studies\"]", "language": "en", "length": [75, 0, 644], "string": "title={Religionsunterricht in Ostdeutschland.

O presente trabalho objetiva analisar o processo de sucess\u00e3o dos padr\u00f5es de mudan\u00e7as da paisagem no munic\u00edpio de Cocos usando sensoriamento remoto. O munic\u00edpio localiza-se na regi\u00e3o do Oeste da Bahia onde ocorre uma intensa expans\u00e3o agr\u00edcola e do agroneg\u00f3cio devido \u00e0s condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais favor\u00e1veis com terras planas e esta\u00e7\u00f5es de chuvas bem definidas. Imagens do sensor ALOS e Landsat 5 foram usadas para produzir os mapas de uso e cobertura da terra nos anos 1996, 2000, 2004 e 2008. A metodologia proposta possui as seguintes etapas: (a) pr\u00e9-processamento das imagens; (b) classifica\u00e7\u00e3o do uso e cobertura da Terra por interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o visual e detec\u00e7\u00e3o de mudan\u00e7a usando o m\u00e9todo de p\u00f3s-classifica\u00e7\u00e3o; (c) an\u00e1lise multitemporal das infraestruturas; e (d) identifica\u00e7\u00e3o do seq\u00fcenciamento dos padr\u00f5es relativos \u00e0 transforma\u00e7\u00e3o dos ambientes naturais em antr\u00f3picos. A agropecu\u00e1ria apresenta uma forte tend\u00eancia de crescimento ao longo do tempo, sendo o principal vetor de altera\u00e7\u00e3o da paisagem natural.

immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope glycoprotein (Env) to the cellular CD4 receptor and a chemokine coreceptor initiates a series of conformational changes in the Env subunits gp120 and gp41. Eventually, the trimeric gp41 folds into a six-helix bundle, thereby inducing fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. C peptides derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) of gp41 are efficient entry inhibitors as they block the six-helix bundle formation. Previously, we developed a membrane-anchored C peptide (maC46) expressed from a retroviral vector that also shows high activity against virus strains resistant to enfuvirtide (T-20), an antiviral C peptide approved for clinical use. Here, we present a systematic analysis of mutations in Env that confer resistance of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) to maC46. We selected an HIV-1 BaL strain with 10-fold reduced sensitivity to maC46 (BaL_C46) by passaging virus for nearly 200 days in the presence of gradually increasing concentrations of maC46. In comparison to wild-type BaL, BaL_C46 had five mutations at highly conserved positions in Env, three in gp120, one in the N-terminal heptad-repeat (NHR), and one in the CHR of gp41. No mutations were found in the NHR domain around the GIV motif that are known to cause resistance to enfuvirtide. Instead, maC46 resistance was found to depend on complementary mutations in the NHR and CHR that considerably favor binding of the mutated NHR to the mutated CHR over binding to maC46. In addition, resistance was highly dependent on mutations in gp120 that accelerated entry. Taken together, resistance to maC46 did not develop readily and required multiple cooperating mutations at conserved positions of the viral envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [128, 0, 378], "string": "title={A Rare Case of Complete Stent Fracture, Coronary Arterial Transection, and Pseudoaneurysm Formation Induced by Repeated Stenting}, container_title={}, abstract={This report describes a rare asymptomatic case of complete stent fracture, coronary arterial transection, and pseudoaneurysm formation in response to repeated stenting.

In this research vibration analysis of a PR-PRP parallel robot using an analytical method is investigated. The PR-PRP parallel robot has two planar degrees of freedom and moves by means of two active prismatic joints. The robot moving platform is a flexible link with one passive revolute and one passive prismatic joint. First, the motion equation for a flexible link with the passive prismatic joint is developed. The motion equation is solved by employing an approximate analytical method called \u201cconstrained assumed modes method\u201d. A time-variant constraint is written for the passive prismatic joint. The developed model allows for inclusion of the effect of physical length for the passive prismatic joint in contact with the moving platform on the vibration response of the system. For verification of the presented model and solution, three case studies are presented and results of the analytical solution are compared with results of a commercial finite element method software. For each case study, two different lengths for the passive prismatic joint are considered.

diversity. Field investigations in the western part of the Greater Caucasus orogen have allowed for the characterization of three localities representing palaeoislands of the Caucasian Sea, which evolved as a semi-enclosed, marginal palaeosea during the Mesozoic. The Gosh locality represents coarse siliciclastics formed on the cliffed shore of the early Induan (Early Triassic) island. The Lipovy locality exhibits conglomerates accumulated on the shore of the early Toarcian (Early Jurassic) island due to erosion of the uplifted crystalline rocks. The Shakhan locality boasts a representative section of cross-bedded sandstones deposited on the alluvial plain of the Hauterivian (Early Cretaceous) island. All these localities are interpreted as geoheritage points, which are parts of larger geosites. Taken together, these points constitute thematic geoheritage sites reflecting the existence of palaeoislands in all Mesozoic periods, which is essential for the understanding of the evolution of the Caucasian Sea during this era. These localities are perfectly accessible, but visiting them requires professional interpretation. The importance of the thematic geoheritage makes its adequate management urgent (particularly, maintenance of geoheritage points, the installation of interpretive panels, and promotion).

In particular cardiopulmonary manifestations, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), are currently the primary cause of death and stabilizing this condiction may represent an important therapeutic goal (1,2). An increased NT-proBNP is predictors of PAH in SSc and use this markers should result in improved PAH risk stratification (3)Some studies have suggested the role of intravenous iloprost in preventing the incidence of most severe vascular complications in long term treated patients (4).Objectives:The aim of our study is to evaluate the evolution of the disease, with particular focus on cardiopulmonary function, in a group of consecutive patients chronically treated with iloprost at the Rheumatology Unit of Catania Hospital, Italy, from 2006 to 2019.Methods:68 SSc patients (58F, 52.88 \u00b1 12.6 years). At baseline, 67.6%, 25% and 5.9% had a limited, diffuse and early scleroderma type respectively and 20,6% had interstitial lung disease. The follow-up period of the study was of 9.9 \u00b1 2.9 years. Iloprost was administered with a regimen of 6 infusions per month (6 hours/day, 0.5-2.0 ng/kg/min) to treat secondary Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon (RP), diagnosed at an average age of 46.6 \u00b1 13.7 years. We evaluated: skin score (SS), systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (PAPs), plane tricuspid annular systolic excursion (TAPSE), lung diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO), forced vital capacity (FVC), alveolar volume (VA), DLCO/VA, pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pBNP), and NYHA class.We analyzed the patients as a whole group (68 subjects), as a group who continued the treatment (57 subjects) and as a group who stopped the treatment during the follow-up (11 patients).Results:After the long follow up period in the study (almost 10 years) in the whole group of patients, PAPs and pBNP showed statistically significant improvement from baseline (30.91 \u00b1 6.4 vs 27.36 \u00b1 7.1 and 97.20 \u00b1 69.3 vs 66.65 \u00b1 44.3 respectively, p Conclusion:Cardiac involvement is recognised as a poor prognostic factor among systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients, significantly to mortality and N-TproBNP peptide may represent a surrogate marker for cardiac involvement in SSc, selectively identifying patients with severe impairment of cardiac function. Our intensive (6 infusions/month) and chronic regimen of iv iloprost administration seems improve the long-term evolution of disease in SSc patients, as suggested by the improvement of cardiopulmonary parameters and the significant improvement of SS.References:[1]Rheumatology 51, 1027-36 2) Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol.32, 223-240 3) Arthritis Rheum. 2008 58, 284-9 4) Rheumatol Int

of primary interest to both engineers and geologists throughout the study, development, and operation of a field. It is therefore desirable for the distribution to be capable of statistical interpretation, to have a simple graphical representation, and to allow data to be entered from either two- or three-dimensional grids. To satisfy these needs while dealing with the geographical variables, new methods have been developed under the name \"geostatistics.\" This paper describes briefly the theory of geostatistics and its most recent improvements for the specific problem of subsurface description. The external-drift technique has been emphasized in particular, and in addition, four case studies related to gas reservoirs are presented to show the wide range of geostatistics application.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Electrical and Electronic Engineering\", \"Mechanical Engineering\", \"Mechanics of Materials\", \"Condensed Matter Physics\", \"Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials\"]", "language": "en", "length": [131, 0, 0], "string": "title={Influence of rotor structures on line-start permanent magnet machines electromagnetic characteristics for pumping units application}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Mechanical Engineering\", \"Mechanics of Materials\", \"Aerospace Engineering\", \"Automotive Engineering\"]", "language": "en", "length": [70, 0, 1082], "string": "title={Periodic Solutions and Controls of Tethered Systems in Elliptic Orbits}, container_title={}, abstract={In this paper we study the periodic solution of the librational motion of a tethered system in elliptic orbit and clarify its mechanical characteristics.

An approximated analytical solution is obtained through the Lindstedt perturbation method. The total mechanical energy is formulated, and it is shown that it has the minimum value when the librational and orbital motions coincide with the periodic solution. This means that the periodic solution is the minimum energy solution, and that the periodic solution in an elliptic orbit has the same significance as the equilibrium state in a circular orbit from the mechanical point of view.

With the use of deep learning and very large training databases, limitations of conventional computer aided detection (CAD) systems, which are widely used in mammography, can be overcome. It is expected that in the coming years algorithms will become more accurate that human readers for interpreting screening mammograms. This will enable physicians to substantially increase quality of mammography. It also will reduce the need for human resources, which is important because many countries face challenges with recruitment of mammographers.

The salient question lies in the more frequent emergence of a series of comorbidities along with the prolongation of the life, which deeply affects the survival in such group. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been recognized to be the third most common cardiovascular condition within people living with HIV (PWH). In terms of its mechanism of action, the occurrence of VTE is quite multifactorial and complex in HIV. Prior exploration concerning the etiology of VTE in PWH identifies general, disease-specific, and miscellaneous factors for explaining its occurrence and development. VTE has constituted an important role in PWH and may increase its all-cause mortality.

printing of displays and imaging. A metallic array on an elastic film can realize dynamic color change by mechanical extensions, such as uniaxial or biaxial stretching. In this study, an electromagnetic model of a flexible metafilm composed of a microscale Al cylindrical array on a polydimethylsiloxane elastic film was constructed to study the underlying optical mechanism of color change, especially brightness and saturation changes, of the flexible metafilm with structural parameters (diameter and height of the Al cylinders) and stretching methods (uniaxial or biaxial stretching). The 3D finite time domain difference method was used to simulate the propagation behavior of electromagnetic waves through metafilm. With increasing diameter, the lightness increases while the saturation decreases, which is due to the change of surface plasmon resonance from local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) to propagation surface plasmon (PSP) and Wood Anomaly (WA) and finally to magnetic polariton excitation. With increasing height, lightness first decreases and then increases, while the change in saturation is opposite, which is due to the first increasing and then decreasing of the intensities of PSP and WA. By comparing the dynamic color changes of metafilm under uniaxial stretching and biaxial stretching, it is found that uniaxial stretching achieves lower lightness and saturation under small strain and higher lightness and saturation under large strain, which is caused by the enhanced WA and PSP on the Al-air interface at short wavelengths and the weakened LSPR on the Al-PDMS interface at long wavelengths. This discovery paves the way for practical applications of structural color display with high saturation and brightness.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

pattern and purpose in Zionist dreams and visions}, container_title={}, abstract={Opening ParagraphAnthropologists are beginning to investigate the sociological dimension of dreams, at least of those purporting to be channels of religious revelation. Two recent examples of this tendency are Charsley (1973) and Curley (1983), each of whom researched dream phenomena in an African independent church. The sociological approach is a firm rejection of earlier and some current attempts to extract patterns of culture and personality from the subjective reconstruction of the dream-as-dreamed, a purely private event. In contrast, the sociological emphasis isolates as its primary datum the dream-as-told to others, an essentially social act, which leads to an analysis of dreams as social assets, which can be manipulated to advantage or disadvantage. Consequently, the method of analysis demands that as much attention be directed to the act of recounting as to the content of the narration, although in practice this seems to mean that content is subordinated to purpose and can be related to social arrangements only indirectly through purposive action. I shall endeavour to correct this latter impression in subsequent argument. The second methodological requirement is to connect narration to social action, social relations and social organization, and to demonstrate the tactical use of dreams in social encounters.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Pharmacology (medical)\", \"Complementary and Alternative Medicine\", \"Pharmaceutical Science\"]", "language": "az", "length": [66, 0, 479], "string": "title={Epidemiological control of parasitic diseases in modern conditions}, container_title={}, abstract={H\u0259yata ke\u00e7iril\u0259n m\u00fcayin\u0259l\u0259rin say\u0259sind\u0259 m\u00fcasir m\u0259rh\u0259l\u0259d\u0259 nematodozlar\u0131n klinik-mikrobioloji x\u00fcsusiyy\u0259tl\u0259ri v\u0259 markerl\u0259ri a\u015fkar edilmi\u015fdir ki, onlar da gizli v\u0259 ya \u00e7\u0259tin a\u015fkar edil\u0259n helmintozlar\u0131n diaqnostikas\u0131na k\u00f6m\u0259k ed\u0259 bil\u0259rl\u0259r.

Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 inhibits overall protein synthesis, but also facilitates the reprogramming of gene expression to adapt to, and recover from, stress. The deduced coding sequence of cobia eIF2\u03b1 has 94% identity to both zebrafish (Danio rerio) and human eIF2\u03b1 sequences with identical phosphorylation and kinase docking sites. Here we use cobia larvae and a cobia cell line derived from muscle (Cm cells) to investigate the response of cobia eIF2\u03b1 to various stressors. In Cm cells, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 is increased by nutrient deficiency and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress), consistent with the activation of the eIF2 kinases, GCN2, and PERK. In cobia juveniles, diet and water temperature affect the phosphorylation state of eIF2\u03b1. We conclude that evaluation of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation could function as an early marker to evaluate diet, environmental stressors, and disease in cobia and may be of particular use in optimizing

Nonsteady Time Series: Application to Tropospheric Ozone Recharging Cycles in the Western Mediterranean Basin}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Environmental measurements often show unsteady variability and background red noise (stochastic component) superimposed on persistent trivial daily, seasonal, and annual variability. In addition to this, environmental time series often present gaps due to a myriad of possible factors, such as malfunction of the sensors, connection loss, etc. As a result, interpreting and identifying periodicities in this type of time series by means of spectral analysis tools, like the Fourier transform, are difficult and lack precision. To overcome these difficulties, a methodology is proposed in the first part of this paper that integrates statistical tools (iterative Student\u2019s t test), parametric reconstruction, and spectral analysis (Lomb periodogram and wavelets). In the second part of the paper, this methodology is tested (i) in the high-frequency part of the spectrum of two (well known) synthetic time series and (ii) to identify nontrivial (e.g., daily cycles) high-frequency periodicities (linked to some mesometeorological processes) in three tropospheric ozone time series recorded by the Valencia regional air quality monitoring network (on the Mediterranean side of Spain) during a 14-yr period. This methodology can determine statistically significant, seasonally dependent recurrences in the high-frequency variability (&lt;15 days) observed in ozone time series measured in a Mediterranean region of Spain under high noise-to-signal ratios.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Activity of Transcriptional Networks Responding to the Pattern of Action Potential Firing in Neurons}, container_title={Genes}, abstract={Transcriptional responses to the appropriate temporal pattern of action potential firing are essential for long-term adaption of neuronal properties to the functional activity of neural circuits and environmental experience. However, standard transcriptome analysis methods can be too limited in identifying critical aspects that coordinate temporal coding of action potential firing with transcriptome response. A Pearson correlation analysis was applied to determine how pairs of genes in the mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons are coordinately expressed in response to stimulation producing the same number of action potentials by two different temporal patterns. Analysis of 4728 distinct gene-pairs related to calcium signaling, 435,711 pairs of transcription factors, 820 pairs of voltage-gated ion channels, and 86,862 pairs of calcium signaling genes with transcription factors indicated that genes become coordinately activated by distinct action potential firing patterns and this depends on the duration of stimulation. Moreover, a measure of expression variance revealed that the control of transcripts abundances is sensitive to the pattern of stimulation. Thus, action potentials impact intracellular signaling and the transcriptome in dynamic manner that not only alter gene expression levels significantly (as previously reported) but also affects the control of their expression fluctuations and profoundly remodel the transcriptional networks.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [83, 0, 0], "string": "title={Perinatal predictors of respiratory symptoms and lung function at a young adult age}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Public Administration\", \"Development\"]", "language": "en", "length": [149, 0, 0], "string": "title={Ladybirds, missionaries and NGOs.

First, kinesthetic learning with a speaking accuracy measuring function to facilitate English as foreign language (EFL) learning is proposed. Namely, this function is about measuring the learners\u2019 speaking accuracy and recognizing whether their body movements and facial expressions match their English speaking content via recognition technology. This function is expected to improve the learners\u2019 pronunciation and motivation during the experiment. Second, we propose Collaborative Kinesthetic English Learning System based on the second-language acquisition method Total Physical Response. By integrating our system with Total Physical Response, it helps the learners improve EFL learning with physical movements and stimulates their memorization and motivation from collaborative perspectives. Finally, the last significant contribution of this study is to design and implement interesting interactive activities: Experience-based Sentence-Making and Interactive Dialogue. These two activities are to help learners produce their English output. In this study, our experimental results show Experience-based Sentence-Making and Interactive Dialogue can significantly improve EFL learning.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

processes to respond to local damage cues is lost from the thalamus, a major site of secondary neurodegeneration (SND). In this study, we combine a photothrombotic stroke model in mice, acute slice and fluorescent imaging to analyse the loss of microglia process responsiveness. The peri-infarct territories and thalamic areas of SND were investigated at time-points 3, 7, 14, 28 and 56 days after stroke. We confirmed the highly specific nature of non-responsive microglia processes to sites of SND. Non-responsiveness was at no time observed at the peri-infarct but started in the thalamus seven days post-stroke and persisted for 56 days. Loss of directed process extension is not a reflection of general functional paralysis as phagocytic function continued to increase over time. Additionally, we identified that somal P2Y12 was present on non-responsive microglia in the first two weeks after stroke but not at later time points. Finally, both classical microglia activation and loss of process extension are highly correlated with neuronal damage. Our findings highlight the importance of microglia, specifically microglia dynamic functions, to the progression of SND post-stroke, and their potential relevance as modulators or therapeutic targets during stroke recovery.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Food Science\", \"Nutrition and Dietetics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [68, 0, 1478], "string": "title={Food Processing: Comparison of Different Food Classification Systems}, container_title={}, abstract={The substitution of minimally processed food and culinary home preparations for ready-to-eat products is increasing worldwide, which is overlooked as a cause of concern.

OBJETIVO: comparar postura e equil\u00edbrio corporal entre os grupos de escolares com e sem respira\u00e7\u00e3o oral considerando a vari\u00e1vel g\u00eanero. M\u00c9TODO: o estudo foi realizado em uma escola municipal da cidade de Santa Maria; foi aprovado pelo Comit\u00ea de \u00c9tica da Universidade Federal de Santa Maria. O grupo estudo (com respira\u00e7\u00e3o oral) e o grupo controle (sem respira\u00e7\u00e3o oral) foram selecionados, baseados na anamnese, na idade (entre 8 a 12 anos), na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema estomatogn\u00e1tico e na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o auditiva. A amostra final ficou composta por 51 escolares no grupo estudo (20 g\u00eanero feminino e 31 g\u00eanero masculino) e 58 escolares no grupo controle (34 g\u00eanero feminino e 24 g\u00eanero masculino). Ambos os grupos foram submetidos \u00e0 posturografia din\u00e2mica (teste de organiza\u00e7\u00e3o sensorial -TOS - e an\u00e1lise sensorial) e \u00e0 avalia\u00e7\u00e3o postural em vista lateral direita e esquerda. RESULTADO: no g\u00eanero feminino encontrou-se diferen\u00e7a estatisticamente significante nos valores obtidos no \u00e2ngulo que analisa o alinhamento horizontal da cabe\u00e7a, nos valores do TOS III e no valor m\u00e9dio de todos os TOS. No g\u00eanero masculino verificou-se diferen\u00e7a numericamente significante nos valores obtidos no \u00e2ngulo do joelho, no \u00e2ngulo do tornozelo, no TOS III, TOS IV e no valor m\u00e9dio de todos os TOS. CONCLUS\u00c3O: escolares com respira\u00e7\u00e3o oral apresentam altera\u00e7\u00f5es posturais; no g\u00eanero feminino no posicionamento cef\u00e1lico e no masculino em membros inferiores. O equil\u00edbrio corporal dos escolares com respira\u00e7\u00e3o oral, em ambos os g\u00eaneros, mostrou estar mais prejudicada em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos escolares sem respira\u00e7\u00e3o oral,

Considerando a abund\u00e2ncia da jurema preta na regi\u00e3o semi\u00e1rida, a sua import\u00e2ncia econ\u00f4mica e ecol\u00f3gica, e o estado de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o provocado pela pecu\u00e1ria em que se encontram muitas \u00e1reas de Caatinga, e ainda levando em considera\u00e7\u00e3o as mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas, neste estudo pretende-se relacionar fatores internos da folha (pigmentos) com fatores externos (temperatura do ar) da jurema preta (Mimosa tenuiflora (Willd) Poiret) de regi\u00e3o semi\u00e1rida do Nordeste do Brasil. Neste estudo, foram aplicadas estat\u00edsticas descritivas e de correla\u00e7\u00e3o linear para relacionar os fatores interno e externos a folha. Os resultados n\u00e3o apresentaram grandes diferen\u00e7as entre a rela\u00e7\u00e3o da temperatura do ar e da temperatura do solo com as clorofilas a e b. Essas informa\u00e7\u00f5es poder\u00e3o servir como base inicial aos estudos do balan\u00e7o energ\u00e9tico e a quantidade de clorofila que poder\u00e1 ser encontrada na esp\u00e9cie estudada (dominante no semi-\u00e1rido). Estudos futuros poder\u00e3o indicar um modelo que apresente uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre a quantidade de clorofila, conhecendo-se a quantidade de energia que a planta recebe (temperatura do ar).}",

This paper offers a model which captures something of the long 1960s as a period of \u2018sea change\u2019 resulting from the interference of three waves. Wave One was an institutional dynamic that drew out experts from closed and hidden disagreement into situations where expert disagreement was open to public scrutiny. Wave One also accounts for the multiplication of experts. Wave Two consisted of social movements, institutions and audiences that could carry public scrutiny and provide a home for sea-change cultures. In particular, Wave Two provided the stage, audience and agents to orchestrate a play of disagreeing experts. Wave Three was marked by an orientation towards the self, in diverse ways. Modern science studies is a phenomenon of Wave Three.

considerada o sentido mais importante para obter informa\u00e7\u00f5es e refer\u00eancias durante o voo, sendo respons\u00e1vel por cerca de 80% da orienta\u00e7\u00e3o no ambiente de avia\u00e7\u00e3o. A acuidade visual (AV) \u00e9 a fun\u00e7\u00e3o visual mais importante testada nos aeronavegantes (indiv\u00edduos cuja fun\u00e7\u00e3o laboral se desenvolve dentro de uma aeronave). A sensibilidade ao contraste (SC) \u00e9 outra importante fun\u00e7\u00e3o visual, definida como a capacidade de discernir uma imagem entre lumin\u00e2ncias de diferentes n\u00edveis. Os testes de SC propiciam uma melhor descri\u00e7\u00e3o das propriedades resolutivas do sistema visual em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s obtidas apenas com a medida da AV. Por esta raz\u00e3o este estudo objetivou caracterizar a SC em uma amostra de militares aeronavegantes e compar\u00e1-la com os resultados de um grupo controle (militares n\u00e3o aeronavegantes). Para tal, foram constitu\u00eddos dois grupos, pelo crit\u00e9rio de acessibilidade, a saber: aeronavegantes (AE; n=58; 34,5 \u00b1 5,77 anos) e grupo controle (GC; n=28; 35,14 \u00b1 7,2 anos), todos do servi\u00e7o ativo e do sexo masculino, totalizando 172 olhos. Os dados foram coletados no momento da inspe\u00e7\u00e3o de sa\u00fade dos militares. Primeiramente, foi realizado o exame oftalmol\u00f3gico conforme as instru\u00e7\u00f5es t\u00e9cnicas em vigor e, na sequ\u00eancia, o teste de SC, utilizando a Tabela de Pelli-Robson. Al\u00e9m disso, foi preenchido um question\u00e1rio para obten\u00e7\u00e3o de informa\u00e7\u00f5es pessoais. Foi realizada a estat\u00edstica descritiva, a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de frequ\u00eancias e a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre vari\u00e1veis qualitativas (teste qui-quadrado), considerando p \u2264 0,05. A pesquisa foi aprovada pelo Comit\u00ea de \u00c9tica em Pesquisa do Hospital de For\u00e7a A\u00e9rea do Gale\u00e3o (N\u00famero de Registro 3.476.886). A SC m\u00e9dia encontrada no grupo de AE foi de 1,71 log SC em olho direito (OD); 1,71 log SC em olho esquerdo (OE) e 1,97 log SC em ambos os olhos (AO). A SC m\u00e9dia encontrada no GC foi de 1,69 log SC em OD; 1,66 log SC em OE e 1,96 log SC em AO. Houve diferen\u00e7a estatisticamente significativa entre os grupos para a SC do OE. A SC do grupo AE foi, em m\u00e9dia, maior que a do GC. Os valores de refer\u00eancia da Tabela de Pelli-Robson encontrados na literatura para a faixa et\u00e1ria estudada foram de 1,80 log SC e 1,95 log SC para medidas monoculares e binoculares, respectivamente. Em ambos os grupos, a m\u00e9dia dos resultados da SC monocular ficou ligeiramente abaixo do valor de refer\u00eancia e a da SC binocular ficou acima desse valor. Para fins periciais, a inclus\u00e3o do teste de SC proporcionaria um exame oftalmol\u00f3gico mais completo, permitindo a detec\u00e7\u00e3o mais precoce de determinadas patologias oculares e de poss\u00edveis altera\u00e7\u00f5es na SC relacionadas \u00e0 realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de cirurgia refrativa. A avalia\u00e7\u00e3o dessa fun\u00e7\u00e3o visual possibilitaria tamb\u00e9m reconhecer aspectos relativos \u00e0 performance visual, contribuindo para a otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o do desempenho humano operacional. Sugere-se estudos posteriores a fim de verificar e categorizar a SC em quadros/especialidades espec\u00edficas para militares.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

However, these differences are reported in ways that are sometimes misleading and often exaggerated, and that generally leave the impression of greater within-gender uniformity than is actually the case. In sum, the importance of gender differences in friendship is overemphasized. The present paper addresses some possible meanings of `importance' as applied to social research. It is intended to be a reminder of some widely acknowledged but easily overlooked points of interpretation concerning the kinds of data with which relationship researchers usually deal. Specific issues are the tendency to reify statistical significance, to overlook within-group variability, and to disregard the implications of gender as a subject variable. Moderation in interpreting and reporting differences and healthy skepticism are offered as simple hedges against exaggerating the importance of gender differences in friendship.}",

introduced in 2014, has proven to be more advantageous for the management of myogenous orofacial pain than the masseteric nerve block, which was introduced in 2009. The twin block is an extraoral nerve block injection which passes through the temporal fossa to anesthetize both the masseteric and the deep temporal nerves as they exit the infratemporal fossa at the infratemporal crest. Similar to the masseteric nerve block, the twin block has demonstrated efficacy with expeditious and sustained relief of myogenous face pain originating from the masseter muscle. Furthermore, in a 6-month prospective treatment study, that has been accepted for publication, the twin block has been demonstrated as comparable to trigger point injections in the management of chronic myofascial pain of masseteric origin. The twin block's ability to mitigate myogenous pain from both the masseter and temporalis muscles and its ease of administration are the key advantages over the masseteric nerve block. Since its inception, we have refined the technique for administering the twin block and our clinical experience corroborates its safety and efficacy.

In this study, hybrid small-diameter vascular grafts made of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and silk fibroin, which possessed a hybrid fibrous structure of an aligned inner layer and a random outer layer, were fabricated by the electrospinning technique using a customized striated collector that generated both aligned and random fibers simultaneously. A methanol post-treatment process induced the transition of fibroin protein conformation from the water-soluble, amorphous, and less ordered structures to the water-insoluble \u03b2-sheet structures that possessed robust mechanical properties and relatively slow proteolytic degradation. The methanol post-treatment also created crimped fibers that mimicked the wavy structure of collagen fibers in natural blood vessels. Ultrafine nanofibers and nanowebs were found on the electrospun TPU/fibroin samples, which effectively increased the surface area for cell adhesion and migration. Cyclic circumferential tensile test results showed compatible mechanical properties for grafts made of a soft TPU/fibroin blend compared to human coronary arteries. In addition, cell culture tests with endothelial cells after 6 and 60 days of culture exhibited high cell viability and good biocompatibility of TPU/fibroin grafts, suggesting the potential of

Since the development of the simple payback method, capital budgeting models have been employed as relative local measures of project evaluation. Because these tools analyze at a static local level, they are limited. By adopting simulation, the effects of capital expenditures and crucial interaction of resources in a dynamic global environment can be studied. Simulation software has improved greatly over the past few years and is becoming more and more common in the manufacturing and consulting environments. Hardware and software technology can provide a real opportunity for those making decisions regarding capital expenditures and can provide opportunity in the decision\u2010making process of the \u201cwhat\u2010if?\u201d scenario. Even though the traditional local optimization measures of performance may show a major advantage in making a purchase, the results of the global measures of performance may show it would bring about a significant financial misfortune to do so.

China}, container_title={}, abstract={Tomato yellow mottle-associated virus (TYMaV), is a member of the genus Cytorhabdovirus in the family Rhabdoviridae, which has been reported to infect tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) (Xu et al. 2017), Solanum nigrum (Li et al., 2022) and Nicotiana benthamiana (Zhou et al. 2019). In July 2021, virus-like symptoms of chlorosis, mosaic, and ring spots were observed in pepper, tomato, and eggplant during a survey of viral symptoms in Huzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China. To identify viral agents potentially associated with these diseases, an Oxford Nanopore cDNA library from the mixed samples was generated and sequenced. Briefly, total RNA from 10 leaf tissue samples (3 pepper plants, 4 tomato plants, and 3 eggplant plants) was extracted using RNAiso Plus (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan) and pooled in equal amounts (100 ng/\uf06dl each). The library was constructed using a PCR-cDNA sequencing kit (SQK-PCS109; Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 8.6 million reads were obtained from the Oxford MinION platform. After removing adapters and low-quality reads using iVar v1.3.1 (Grubaugh et al., 2019), the clean reads were subjected to BLASTn search in the GenBank database. We identified sequences derived from potato virus X (PVX), potato virus Y (PVY), cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), pepper mottle virus (PepMoV), and TYMaV. Of these reads, 339 with lengths ranging from 375 to 8651 nt were mapped to the genome of TYMaV (GeneBank Accession No. KY075646.1) at a 98.2% query coverage. To identify TYMaV-infected plants in the pooled samples, all 10 samples were analyzed by two-step RT-PCR using AMV reverse transcriptase (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) combined with random primers N6 (Takara, Dalian, China) and high-fidelity DNA polymerase KOD-Plus-Neo (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) with primer pairs: N-F 5\u2032- CAGGGAGAGAATGTACAAGTTGATC\u2032/N-R 5\u2032- GACCTTGCTCATCTGATGCAAC -3\u2032, amplifying 420 bp of the 3\u2032end of nucleoprotein (N) gene. A pepper sample showing chlorosis symptom was positive for the TYMaV infection, but negative for PVX, PVY, CMV or PepMoV infection when tested using the primers listed in table S1. To confirm the genome sequence of TYMaV Zhejiang isolate (TYMaV-ZJ), we carried out two-step RT-PCR with seven primer pairs (Table S1) designed based on the reference TYMaV genome (GeneBank accession number KY075646.1). PCR products were cloned into pLB vector (Tiangen, Beijing, China) and Sanger sequenced in both directions. At least five independent clones of each fragment were sequenced to avoid possible mutations introduced by PCT. The sequences were assembled into a nearlyfull-length genome of TYMaV \u2013ZJ which was composed of 13344nt (GeneBank accession number OP296980). Pairwise sequence comparison revealed that TYMaV -ZJ genome shared 91.50% and 85.59% nt sequence identity with that of the TYMaV tomato isolate (KY075646.1) and the Solanum nigrum isolate (MW527091.1), which is higher than the species demarcation threshold of 75% for the genus Cytorhabdovirus (Walker et al., 2022).

and the Cleft Lip and Palate Association, set priorities for unanswered questions in cleft management. One of these priorities included postoperative fluid management. The authors\u2019 postoperative regimen does not include intravenous fluids unless the child fails to achieve adequate oral intake by the first evening postoperatively. This audit evaluated whether this is appropriate and safe practice. Methods All patients undergoing cleft-related surgery by a single surgeon in a single center during August 2011 to August 2012 were included. Patient age, weight, and surgery type were recorded together with fluid requirement, length of stay, and any returns to theater or readmissions. Result Of the 79 patients included, none required readmission or return to theater, and the mean length of stay was 1.72 days. Nineteen patients (24%) required intravenous fluids, but these tended to be the older children in the group (P value .034). In the youngest patients undergoing primary lip repair, only 1 of 20 required intravenous fluids. Conclusions This study demonstrates that, especially in the younger patients, omitting intravenous fluids as a postoperative routine is associated with a shorter length of stay without an increased complication rate. The authors advocate early postoperative feeding and the return to physiological fluid balance.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Electrical and Electronic Engineering\"]", "language": "en", "length": [84, 36, 0], "string": "title={Component reduced all-pass filter with a grounded capacitor and high-impedance input}, container_title={International Journal of Electronics}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [101, 0, 0], "string": "title={A novel simple external fixation for securing silicone stent in patients with upper tracheal stenosis}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Computer Science Applications\", \"Control and Systems Engineering\"]", "language": "en", "length": [119, 0, 0], "string": "title={Task-space fully distributed tracking control of networked uncertain robotic manipulators without velocity measurements}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Instrumentation\"]", "language": "en", "length": [49, 0, 319], "string": "title={A TEM Study of Cr Based Contacts to (0001) 6H-SiC}, container_title={}, abstract={6H-SiC is a wide band-gap semiconductor.

presents a set covering model based on route representation to solve the green ship routing and scheduling problem (GSRSP) with berth time-window constraints for multiple bulk ports. A bi-objective set covering model is constructed with features based on the minimization of the total CO2 equivalent emissions and the total travel time subject to a limited number of berths in each port, berthing time windows, and the time window for each job. The solutions are obtained using the \u03b5-constraint method, after which a Pareto frontier is plotted. This problem is motivated by the operations of feeder barges and terminals, where the logistics control tower is used to coordinate the routing and berthing time of its barges.

Utilizing the unique properties of a disordered photonic crystal for detecting the bio-analytes is still missing. This work incorporates the opto-biological properties of one-dimensional random photonic systems to design the two differently randomized biosensors for sensing breast cancer cells. These random sensors are differentiated from one another based on their random arrangements and random thicknesses. To obtain efficient outcomes, the thickness of the dielectric layers and sensing layer is optimized. Through the transfer matrix method, the sensing characteristics of the biosensors are investigated for different pressures (0\u20136 GPa) and temperatures (\u2212125 \u00b0C to 25 \u00b0C). At the optimal range, the proposed Biosensors I and II, show a high sensitivity of 1372.549 nm/RIU. Among both sensors, Random Biosensor I exhibits a high-quality factor of 12925, a maximum FOM of 4575.163 RIU\u22121, and a very low detection limit in the order of 5.82857E-06 RIU. The designed sensor is capable of sensing very minuscule changes in the bio-analytes effectually.

Behaviors with Differential Effects on Hippocampal Neurogenesis in Chronically Stressed Mice}, container_title={International Journal of Molecular Sciences}, abstract={Depression is a neuropsychiatric disorder with a high impact on the worldwide population. To overcome depression, antidepressant drugs are the first line of treatment. However, pre-clinical studies have pointed out that antidepressants are not entirely efficacious and that the quality of the living environment after stress cessation may play a relevant role in increasing their efficacy. As it is unknown whether a short daily exposure to environmental enrichment during chronic stress and antidepressant treatment will be more effective than just the pharmacological treatment, this study analyzed the effects of fluoxetine, environmental enrichment, and their combination on depressive-associated behavior. Additionally, we investigated hippocampal neurogenesis in mice exposed to chronic mild stress. Our results indicate that fluoxetine reversed anhedonia. Besides, fluoxetine reversed the decrement of some events of the hippocampal neurogenic process caused by chronic mild stress. Conversely, short daily exposure to environmental enrichment changed the deterioration of the coat and anhedonia. Although, this environmental intervention did not produce significant changes in the neurogenic process affected by chronic mild stress, fluoxetine plus environmental enrichment showed similar effects to those caused by environmental enrichment to reverse depressive-like behaviors. Like fluoxetine, the combination reversed the declining number of Ki67, doublecortin, calretinin cells and mature newborn neurons. Finally, this study suggests that short daily exposure to environmental enrichment improves the effects of fluoxetine to reverse the deterioration of the coat and anhedonia in chronically stressed mice. In addition, the combination of fluoxetine with environmental enrichment produces more significant effects than those caused by fluoxetine alone on some events of the neurogenic process. Thus, environmental enrichment improves the benefits of pharmacological treatment by mechanisms that need to be clarified.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Assay Discordance in a Pediatric Cohort.}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract \u201cAspirin resistance\u201d (i.e., inadequate platelet inhibition as suggested by ex vivo assays in patients on aspirin) has been reported to occur commonly in adults and has been linked to an increased risk of adverse clinical events in this age group. However, its prevalence and clinical significance are largely unknown in children, with only limited pediatric data available. We have studied 22 children (ages 1 to 17 years) started on aspirin therapy for various indications (12 with a history of ischemic stroke, 6 after intervention via cardiac catheterization or surgery, 3 with a primary rheumatologic diagnosis, 1 with thrombocytosis) using a variety of measures of platelet inhibition, including optical aggregometry, PFA-100\u00ae and urinary thromboxane B2 concentration. We considered previously published definitions of aspirin resistance in adults, including \u2265 70% aggregation to 10 \u03bcM adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and \u2265 20% aggregation to 0.5 mg/mL arachidonic acid (AA), normal PFA-100 closure time (collagen/epinephrine cartridge) and normal urinary thromboxane B2 concentration (normal range defined by healthy pediatric controls). Subjects had received aspirin for a minimum of one week (range 1 to 249 weeks) prior to testing and mean aspirin dose was 3.4 mg/kg/d (range 1.3 to 7.9). Only 1 of 22 pediatric subjects (5%) met any of the pre-specified definitions for aspirin resistance; this single subject exhibited a normal PFA-100 closure time while receiving aspirin but was not aspirin resistant according to optical aggregometry or urinary thromboxane B2 criteria. Two other subjects on aspirin exhibited inappropriately \u201cnormal\u201d aggregation to either ADP or AA (but not both). Each subject on aspirin excreted low levels of urinary thromboxane B2 compared with healthy non-medicated controls. To confirm an aspirin effect, five subjects were studied prior to initiation of aspirin therapy; each demonstrated pronounced changes in measured parameters after aspirin dosing (e.g. mean aggregation to AA decreased from 83 to 7%, p&lt;.001). The small number of subjects who demonstrated any evidence of aspirin resistance did not differ from fully aspirin responsive subjects in terms of age, gender, race, platelet count, or aspirin dose, indication or therapy duration. Nor was there significant correlation between any of the measures of aspirin resistance we studied. In this initial prevalence study of a clinically diverse group of pediatric patients, laboratory evidence of aspirin resistance was not commonly encountered, despite our utilization of a broad panel of assays previously reported to identify aspirin resistance in adults. The prevalence of aspirin resistance in children thus appears low, and possibly less than that in adults. However, for the minority of pediatric patients who demonstrate laboratory evidence of aspirin resistance, this finding may hold clinical relevance; clinical follow-up of this cohort is ongoing. Finally, the lack of correlation we observed between assays previously linked to adverse clinical outcomes in patients taking aspirin supports that multiple molecular mechanisms contribute to the clinical phenotype of aspirin treatment failure.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

multilocularis, which usually requires multidisciplinary management including surgery as the only curative approach. In recent years, minimally invasive strategies have been increasingly adopted for liver surgery. In particular, robotic surgery enables surgeons to perform even complex liver resections using a minimally invasive approach. However, there are only a few reports on robotic liver surgery for AE. Consecutive patients undergoing robotic liver surgery for AE were analysed based on the prospective database of the Interdisciplinary Robotic Centre of Ulm University Hospital. Between January 2021 and August 2022, a total of 16 patients with AE underwent robotic hepatectomy at our institution. Median age was 55.5 years (23\u201373), median body mass index (BMI) was 25.8 kg/m2 (20.2\u201336.8) and 12 patients (75%) were female. Anatomic resections were performed in 14 patients (87.5%), of which 4 patients (25%) underwent major hepatectomies (i.e., resection of >3 segments) including two right hemihepatectomies, one left hemihepatectomy and one extended right hemihepatectomy performed as associating liver partition with portal vein ligation staged (ALPPS) hepatectomy. There was no 90-day mortality, no postoperative bile leakage and no posthepatectomy haemorrhage. One patient developed posthepatectomy liver failure grade B after extended right hemihepatectomy using an ALPPS approach. One patient had to be converted to open surgery and developed an organ-space surgical site infection, for which he was re-admitted and underwent intravenous antibiotic therapy. Median length of postoperative hospital stay was 7 days (4\u201330). To our knowledge, this is the largest series of robotic liver surgeries for AE. The robotic approach seems safe with promising short-term outcomes in this selected cohort for both minor as well as major resections.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Pharmacology (medical)\"]", "language": "en", "length": [93, 0, 0], "string": "title={Gabapentin Extended-Release Tablets for the Treatment of Patients with Postherpetic Neuralgia}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Mechanical Engineering\", \"Mechanics of Materials\"]", "language": "en", "length": [137, 0, 0], "string": "title={Bandgap Enhancement: Bandgap Control of the Oxygen-Vacancy-Induced Two-Dimensional Electron Gas in SrTiO3 (Adv.

plan, the financing of health care must provide for appropriate pediatric care. An unacceptable level of mortality and morbidity persists today among American children, and it is clear that archaic and inequitable financing mechanisms contribute to this circumstance. Waste, inefficiency, and discrimination against children in current financing systems must give way to improvements that maximize access to comprehensive pediatric care and ensure the quality of the care. As both the public and private sectors continue to explore the redesign of health financing, the following principles are among those against which the Academy will weigh proposed changes. 1. Children's Right to Access to the Health Care System. \u2022 All children have a right to health care. \u2022 Financial barriers should not prevent children from receiving comprehensive health care. \u2022 When families are unable to provide for adequate health financing, through employment, purchase of a private plan, or personal means, children should be covered by a comprehensive public plan. \u2022 Health care financing systems should permit reasonable options for the patient to choose appropriate providers of services. 2. Standards for Comprehensiveness and Quality Assurance. \u2022 Health care financing systems should cover medical care needed by infants, children, and adolescents, including prenatal consultations, newborn care, preventive care, health supervision, and treatment services through age 21 years. \u2022 Heealth care financing systems should encourage continuity of care by primary care physicians. \u2022 Health care financing systems should recognize the value eof cognitive services in addition to procedural services. \u2022 Health care financing systems should cover physician-directed ancillary and rehabilitative services.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Process Chemistry and Technology\", \"Energy Engineering and Power Technology\", \"Fuel Technology\"]", "language": "ru", "length": [59, 0, 0], "string": "title={\u0420\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043a \u043a \u0442\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043c (\u043e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440)}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Emergency Medicine\", \"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health\"]", "language": "en", "length": [87, 0, 0], "string": "title={Assessment of Factors Associated With the Delayed Transfer of Pediatric Trauma Patients}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Plant Science\", \"Agronomy and Crop Science\"]", "language": "en", "length": [101, 15, 1218], "string": "title={2,4-D Rate Response, Absorption, and Translocation of Two Ground Ivy (Glechoma hederacea) Populations}, container_title={Weed Technology}, abstract={Ground ivy is a stoloniferous, perennial weed that persists in lawn turf. With the widespread use of 2,4-D on turf sites, the development of 2,4-D\u2013tolerant ground ivy is a possibility. Ground ivy populations showed a highly variable response to foliar 2,4-D application. Ground ivy from Nebraska (NE) was tolerant to 2,4-D, whereas Ohio (OH) ground ivy was susceptible. The 2,4-D\u2013susceptible OH population absorbed 37% more foliar-applied14C\u20132,4-D than the 2,4-D\u2013tolerant NE population. Although OH and NE populations total translocation of applied14C was similar and averaged 5%, the OH population translocated 42% more toward the apical meristem of the primary stolon than the NE population, primarily because of the OH population's higher14C\u20132,4-D absorption. The variation in response to 2,4-D found between these two populations occurred after exposure of roots to 2,4-D, but the effect was less pronounced. These results suggest that the difference in foliar uptake may partially contribute to differences in response to 2,4-D between these two populations. Likewise, differences in acropetal translocation may contribute to the differential sensitivity of 2,4-D\u2013tolerant and \u2013susceptible ground ivy populations.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 1, 0,

embodiment of the noetic cycle, the cyclical relationship of two theories of noesis, Aristotle\u2019s and Husserl\u2019s. Aristotle describes noesis as the thinking and planning of work to be done. Husserl\u2019s noesis describes the reception of sensuous information and the translation of that information into actionable data. Using videos of my solo release-based improvised dancing in the studio, I discuss how each theory of noesis is present in practice. These theories of noesis, when seen as complementary to one another, reveal improvised dance making as arising from the interrelationship of awareness and action. The noetic cycle provides dance makers with more theoretical lenses for researching dance and shows that dance is a testing ground and the means for philosophical inquiry.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0,

understood. Numerous studies have suggested that oxidative stress may play a role in the pathophysiology of vitiligo. There are controversial reports as to the changes of serum trace elements, copper and zinc levels in vitiligo patients. Objective: In this study, we evaluated the alterations in the level of serum Cu and Zn among a group of Iranian vitiligo patients. Methods: The levels of serum Cu and Zn were compared between 117 vitiligo patients and 137 healthy controls using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Results: The mean Cu and Zn levels in the case group (113.57 \u00b1 59.43 and 95.01 \u00b1 58.95 \u03bcg/dl, respectively) were significantly lower than those of the control group (138.90 \u00b1 38.14 and 121.83 \u00b1 33.80 \u03bcg/dl, respectively) (p= 0.00).

Due to the evolutionary nature of the CDO design process, stochastic search methods that mimic the metaphor of natural biological evolution are applied. For efficient searching the optimal solution, the nondominating sort genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used, which places emphasis on moving towards the true Paretooptimal region. This is an essential part of real-world credit structuring problems. The algorithm further demonstrates attractive constraint handling features among others, which is suitable for successfully solving the constrained portfolio optimisation problem. Numerical analysis is conducted on a bespoke CDO collateral portfolio constructed from constituents of the iTraxx Europe IG S5 CDS index. For comparative purposes, the default dependence structure is modelled via Gaussian and Clayton copula assumptions. This research concludes that CDO tranche returns at all levels of risk under the Clayton copula assumption performed better than the sub-optimal Gaussian assumption. It is evident that our research has provided meaningful guidance to CDO traders, for seeking significant improvement of returns over standardised CDOs tranches of similar rating.}",

Therefore, the permanent magnet lifting device has the advantages of energy saving, reliable use, low cost and high weight absorption ratio. This paper introduces the development of permanent magnet lifting technology, including the working principle and design problems of permanent magnet lifting device. According to the different demagnetization methods, it can be divided into electromagnetic demagnetization type lifting permanent magnets and mechanical demagnetization type lifting permanent magnets.

Previous research has indicated that restrained eaters (i.e., chronic dieters) might fail in their attempts at weight control because the perception of attractive food cues triggers hedonic thoughts about food and inhibits their dieting goal. However, recent work suggests that in some dieters, temptation cues activate the relevant goal and thus facilitate self-regulation. The present work extends these findings by showing that self-regulatory success moderates the effect of food cues on restrained eaters such that food cues activate the dieting goal in successful restrained eaters and inhibit the dieting goal in unsuccessful restrained eaters. The specific time course of these effects was examined. Moreover, a correlational study revealed that only successful restrained eaters translate their dieting intentions into action.

Methods Medline/PubMed, ClinicalKey, ScienceDirect, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library were searched throughout the month of June, 2019. Randomized controlled trials comparing yoga groups with control groups in women with sleep problems were included. Two reviewers independently evaluated risk of bias by using the risk of bias tool suggested by the Cochrane Collaboration for programming and conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The main outcome measure was sleep quality or the severity of insomnia, which was measured using subjective instruments, such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), or objective instruments such as polysomnography, actigraphy, and safety of the intervention. For each outcome, a standardized mean difference (SMD) and confidence intervals (CIs) of 95% were determined. Results Nineteen studies in this systematic review included 1832 participants. The meta-analysis of the combined data conducted according to Comprehensive Meta-Analysis showed a significant improvement in sleep (SMD = \u2212 0.327, 95% CI = \u2212 0.506 to \u2212 0.148, P P = 0.003). However, three RCTs revealed no effects of yoga compared to the control group in reducing insomnia among women using ISI (SMD = \u2212 0.13; 95% CI = \u2212 0.74 to 0.48; P = 0.69). Seven RCTs revealed no evidence for effects of yoga compared with the control group in improving sleep quality for women with breast cancer using PSQI (SMD = \u2212 0.15; 95% CI = \u2212 0.31 to 0.01; P = 0.5). Four RCTs revealed no evidence for the effects of yoga compared with the control group in improving the sleep quality for peri/postmenopausal women using PSQI (SMD = \u2212 0.31; 95% CI = \u2212 0.95 to 0.33; P = 0.34). Yoga was not associated with any serious adverse events. Discussion This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that yoga intervention in women can be beneficial when compared to non-active control conditions in term of managing sleep problems. The moderator analyses suggest that participants in the non-breast cancer subgroup and participants in the non-peri/postmenopausal subgroup were associated with greater benefits, with a direct correlation of total class time with quality of sleep among other related benefits.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

CBFA2T1 (ETO, MTG8) and CBFA2T3 (ETO2, MTG16) are targeted by chromosomal translocations in acute myeloid leukemia. To better understand the usual hematopoietic function of this gene family, we examined the expression of CBFA2T RNA using RQ-PCR in cell-lines and human CD34+ hematopoietic cells during macrophage and erythroid differentiation. RQ-PCR on extracted RNA was performed with an icyclerQ instrument (Bio-Rad) using the Quantitect SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and in vitro transcribed RNA to construct standard curves. CBFA2T3 was the most highly expressed family member in human CD34+ cells, the erythro-leukemia line K562, the myeloid line MPD, the T cell line Jurkatt and the B-cell line LCL-11. However, CBFA2T3 expression decreased by &gt;50% during both macrophage and erythroid differentiation of human CD34+ cells. In contrast, CBFA2T1 expression was almost undetectable in human CD34+ cells and all cell lines except K562 but increased more than 20 fold during erythroid (but not macrophage) differentiation of human CD34+ cells. Extrinsic over-expression of CBFA2T1, but not CBFA2T2, significantly increased glycophorin-A and hemoglobin A expression in K562 cells, consistent with a regulatory role for CBFA2T1 in erythroid differentiation. CBFA2T2 (MTGR1) was moderately expressed in human CD34+ cells and all the cell lines and demonstrated a 2.5 fold increase in expression with macrophage differentiation but essentially no change with erythroid differentiation of human CD34+ cells.

article explores relations within the milieu of Jewish elites involved in the oil industry of two towns in Eastern Galicia \u2013 Drohobych and Boryslav \u2013 in the second half of 19th century. The oil industry, one of the unique examples of early industrialization in Galicia, attracted numerous Jewish participants, especially in the initial stages. They became workers, overseers and entrepreneurs, less or more successful. The Jewish communities of both cities were socially and culturally diverse. This article examines the formation and structure of Jewish economic elites, arguing that kin relations and connections with elites in a non-Jewish environment helped a group of oil entrepreneurs to distinguish themselves from others and sustain business. Though 19th-century industry in Galicia inspired writers with the idea of the oil magnate gaining wealth overnight, the formation of Jewish elites in Drohobych and Boryslav was a long process, which required the ability to connect with different networks.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cancer Research\", \"Oncology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [195, 0, 3107], "string": "title={Abstract CT109: Phase I study of mTORC1-2 inhibitor sapanisertib (TAK-228) in combination with carboplatin plus paclitaxelin patients with advanced solid malignancies and mTOR pathway alterations}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Introduction: Pre-clinical models show that the addition of the mTORC1/2 inhibitor sapanisertib (TAK-228) restores sensitivity to platinum chemotherapy and dramatically enhances paclitaxel-induced cancer cell killing. Carboplatin plus paclitaxel is an established therapy in a variety of cancers including non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer and others. This phase 1 study (NCT03430882) assessed the safety and tolerability of sapanisertib in combination with carboplatin plus paclitaxel in patients with advanced solid malignancies enriched with mTOR pathway alterations. Methods: Eligible patients, enriched for mTOR pathway aberrant tumors by CLIA-certified next-generation sequencing, received increasing sapanisertib doses on day 2-4 of each week at 2mg (Dose level 1; 4 patients), 3mg (Dose level 2; 4 patients) and 4mg (Dose level 3; 4 patients) combined with carboplatin (AUC 5) intravenously every 3 weeks on day 1 of each cycle plus paclitaxel 40mg/m2 (Dose levels 1-3), 60mg/m2 (Dose level 4; 7 patients) on day 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle. Results: Among the patients enrolled, males were 8/19 (42%), median age was 59 (range: 33-74). Of the 12 patients treated with Dose levels 1-3, 11 patients were evaluable for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and no DLTs were observed. Seven patients were treated in Dose level 4 and among the 6 patients that were evaluable for DLTs, 1 patient had a DLT. Genomic alterations included PI3K/PTEN in 11/19 (58%), NF1 in 2/19 (10.5%), NF2 in 2/19 (10.5%), TSC1 in 1/19 (5%), TSC2 in 1/19 (5%), and EWSR1-POU5F1 fusion in 1/19 (5%). Of 17 patients evaluable for response, disease control rate (CR+PR+SD) was 76.4 % including 2 patients who achieved partial response. Responders were a patient with sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma harboring EWSR1-POU5F1 fusion, who remains on therapy for more than 18 months. In addition, a patient with castrate resistant prostate cancer who progressed on cabazitaxel but harbors PTEN loss and remained on therapy for 7.3 months. There were no unanticipated toxicities. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events included anemia (4/19; 21%), neutropenia (4/19; 21%), thrombocytopenia (2/19; 10.5%), and transaminitis (1/19; 5%). Conclusion: Sapanisertib in combination with carboplatin plus paclitaxel demonstrated a manageable safety profile, with preliminary antitumor activity observed in patients with advanced malignancies harboring mTOR pathway alterations.

Bi-weekly measurements of biuretolytic activity of ruminal ingesta were made before, during and after the supplementation of biuret to poor, medium and high-quality rations. Generally no activity was found prior to biuret feeding, but an almost immediate response to biuret feeding occurred which increased progressively with the number of days the animals were fed biuret. The time required to reach maximum activity on very low, medium and somewhat higher protein diets were found to be 15, 30 and 70 days approximately. The supplementation with starch in addition to biuret was found to increase biuretolytic activity. Since neither protein nor starch was found to have any direct effect on biuretolytic activity in vitro, a change in numbers of biuretolytic organisms in the ingesta is discussed as a likely mechanism for the adaptation and de-adaptation of the ruminal flora. A stoichiometric conversion of biuret-N to NH3-N by active ingesta was demonstrated in vitro but was not reflected by the nitrogen levels in vivo. The activity of the ingesta was greatly reduced by straining.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0,

measuring the 3D turbulent velocity dispersion of molecular clouds}, container_title={}, abstract={ABSTRACT The structure and star formation activity of a molecular cloud are fundamentally linked to its internal turbulence. However, accurately measuring the turbulent velocity dispersion is challenging due to projection effects and observational limitations, such as telescope resolution, particularly for clouds that include non-turbulent motions, such as large-scale rotation. Here, we develop a new method to recover the 3D turbulent velocity dispersion (\u03c3v,3D) from position\u2013position\u2013velocity (PPV) data. We simulate a rotating, turbulent, collapsing molecular cloud, and compare its intrinsic \u03c3v,3D with three different measures of the velocity dispersion accessible in PPV space: (1) the spatial mean of the 2nd-moment map, \u03c3i, (2) the standard deviation of the gradient/rotation-corrected 1st-moment map, \u03c3(c \u2212 grad), and (3) a combination of (1) and (2), called the \u2018gradient-corrected parent velocity dispersion\u2019, $\\sigma _{\\mathrm{(p}-\\mathrm{grad)}}=(\\sigma _{\\mathrm{i}}^2+\\sigma _{(\\mathrm{c}-\\mathrm{grad)}}^2)^{1/2}$. We show that the gradient correction is crucial in order to recover purely turbulent motions of the cloud, independent of the orientation of the cloud with respect to the line of sight. We find that with a suitable correction factor and appropriate filters applied to the moment maps, all three statistics can be used to recover \u03c3v,3D, with method 3 being the most robust and reliable. We determine the correction factor as a function of the telescope beam size for different levels of cloud rotation, and find that for a beam full width at half-maximum f and cloud radius R, the 3D turbulent velocity dispersion can best be recovered from the gradient-corrected parent velocity dispersion via $\\sigma _{v,\\mathrm{3D}}= \\left[(-0.29\\pm 0.26)\\, f/R + 1.93 \\pm 0.15\\right] \\sigma _{\\mathrm{(p}-\\mathrm{grad)}}$ for f/R &lt; 1, independent of the level of cloud rotation or LOS orientation.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Materials Chemistry\", \"Condensed Matter Physics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [98, 0, 0], "string": "title={Reconstruction of the (111)-surfaces of homopolar semiconductors: A nonlinear polarizability model}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Computer Science Applications\", \"History\", \"Education\"]", "language": "en", "length": [92, 37, 514], "string": "title={Research on Construction Technology of Ultra-Low Energy Reconstruction of Existing Buildings}, container_title={Journal of Physics: Conference Series}, abstract={Abstract Taking the renovation project of the family building of the Hebei Academy of Building Research as an example.

paracellular pathways. Our understanding of the molecular machinery involved is increasing. Ca2+and Mg2+reclamation in kidney is dependent on a diverse array of proteins, which are important for both forming divalent cation-permeable pores and channels, but also for generating the necessary driving forces for Ca2+and Mg2+transport. Alterations in these molecular constituents can have profound effects on tubular Ca2+and Mg2+handling. Diuretics are used to treat a large range of clinical conditions, but most commonly for the management of blood pressure and fluid balance. The pharmacological targets of diuretics generally directly facilitate sodium (Na+) transport, but also indirectly affect renal Ca2+and Mg2+handling, i.e., by establishing a prerequisite electrochemical gradient. It is therefore not surprising that substantial alterations in divalent cation handling can be observed following diuretic treatment. The effects of diuretics on renal Ca2+and Mg2+handling are reviewed in the context of the present understanding of basal molecular mechanisms of Ca2+and Mg2+transport. Acetazolamide, osmotic diuretics, Na+/H+exchanger (NHE3) inhibitors, and antidiabetic Na+/glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT) blocking compounds, target the proximal tubule, where paracellular Ca2+transport predominates. Loop diuretics and renal outer medullary K+(ROMK) inhibitors block thick ascending limb transport, a segment with significant paracellular Ca2+and Mg2+transport. Thiazides target the distal convoluted tubule; however, their effect on divalent cation transport is not limited to that segment. Finally, potassium-sparing diuretics, which inhibit electrogenic Na+transport at distal sites, can also affect divalent cation transport.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

The amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and method sequence data of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) were used to study the genetic diversity and relationships of Saprolegnia spp. collected from Canada, Chile, Japan, Norway and Scotland. AFLP analysis of 37 Saprolegnia spp. isolates using six primer combinations gave a total of 163 clear polymorphic bands. Bayesian cluster analysis using genetic similarity divided the isolates into three main groups, suggesting that there are genetic relationships among the isolates. The unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) and principal coordinate analysis (PCO) confirmed the pattern of the cluster analyses. ITS analyses of 48 Saprolegnia sequences resulted in five well-defined clades. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed greater variation within countries (91.01%) than among countries (8.99%). We were able to distinguish the Saprolegnia isolates according to their species, ability to produce oogonia with and without long spines on the cysts and their ability to or not to cause mortality in salmonids. AFLP markers and ITS sequencing data obtained in the study, were found to be an efficient tool to characterize the genetic diversity and relationships of Saprolegnia spp. The comparison of AFLP

Technical efficiency is estimated using well-known data envelopment analysis (DEA) approaches and a bootstrapped DEA model. To solve the problem of measuring sporting results as output in knockout competitions, we propose the use of the coefficients applied by the UEFA from UCL revenue distribution. The results obtained show first that there is a high level of inefficiency in UCL over the period studied: Only 10% of the teams seem to be efficient. Also, the teams have many problems in maintaining their efficiency during the seasons. Second, the champion is always efficient. Third, we identify two sources of inefficiency: waste of sports resources and the selection of sporting tactics. Finally, from a methodological perspective, the output measure proposed seems to be suitable to represent reliably the sports results achieved by clubs in this qualifying competition type. Furthermore, our results are robust when applying alternative estimation methods. Regarding the results, some management implications are discussed and suggestions are made to boost the efficiency in inefficient clubs.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
