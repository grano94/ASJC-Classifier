Possible adverse health effects due to mercury released by amalgam fillings have been discussed in several studies of patients who attribute various symptoms to the effects of amalgam fillings. No systematic relation of specific symptoms to increased mercury levels could be established in any of these studies. Thus, a psychosomatic aetiology of the complaints should be considered and psychological factors contributing to their aetiology should be identified.Methods. A screening questionnaire was used to identify subjects who were convinced that their health had already been affected seriously by their amalgam fillings (N = 40). These amalgam sensitive subjects were compared to amalgam non-sensitive subjects (N = 43). All participants were subjected to dental, general health, toxicological and psychological examinations.Results. The two groups did not differ with respect to the number of amalgam fillings, amalgam surfaces or mercury levels assessed in blood, urine or saliva. However, amalgam sensitive subjects had significantly higher symptom scores both in a screening instrument for medically unexplained somatic symptoms (SOMS) and in the SCL-90-R Somatization scale. Additionally, more subjects from this group (50% versus 4\u00b77%) had severe somatization syndromes. With respect to psychological risk factors, amalgam sensitive subjects had a self-concept of being weak and unable to tolerate stress, more cognitions of environmental threat, and increased habitual anxiety. These psychological factors were significantly correlated with the number and intensity of the reported somatic symptoms.Conclusions. While our results do not support an organic explanation of the reported symptoms, they are well in accord with the notion of a psychological aetiology of the reported symptoms and complaints. The findings suggest that self-diagnosed \u2018amalgam illness\u2019 is a label for a general tendency toward somatization.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

biogeographical issues. \u2014 The avifauna of the Loyalty Islands comprises 62 species, including 14 breeding or erratic seabirds, 5 migratory birds, 7 herons, ducks and rails, 4 birds of prey, 28 indigenous land breeders (belonging to 33 subspecies) and 2 species introduced from the Grande Terre (main island of New Caledonia). Six species are endemic : 3 on the Grande Terre and in the Loyalty Islands (New Caledonian Friarbird Philemon diemenensis, Green-backed White-eye Zosterops xanthochrous, Striated Starling Aplonis striatus) and 3 only found in the Loyalty Islands (Ouvea Parakeet Eunymphicus uvaeensis, Large Lifou White-eye Zosterops inornatus and Small Lifou White-eye Z. minutus). Eunymphicus is an endemic genus of New Caledonia. Eight subspecies are endemic to both the Grande Terre and the Loyalty Islands and 11 are exclusive of the Loyalty Islands. Of the 24 taxa whose geographical origin could be identified, 58% are identical or similar to those on the Grande Terre, 105 km away, and 42% have affinities with birds in Vanuatu, twice as far away (225 km). The paths of cyclones could explain the specific influence of Vanuatu. The correlation between the islands\u2019land area and the number of species that have successfully settled is very close (r = 0.97) and confirms this biogeographical standard. The land breeding species frequencies vary, with rare localized species limited to some islands (Bluefaced Parrotfinch Erythrura trichroa, Ouvea Parakeet), or possibly extinct (Island Thrush Turdus poliocephalus) and others whose frequency varies widely from place to place (Fan-tailed Cuckoo Cacomantis flabelliformis, Gerygone Gerygone flavolateralis, Silvereye Zosterops lateralis), while others show high (Red-bellied Fruit-Dove Ptilinopus greyii), average (Melanesian Flycatcher Myiagra caledonica, Sacred Kingfischer Todiramphus sanctus) or low (Emerald Dove Chalcophaps indica) frequencies that remain comparable between these islands. The species ecology has been determined with some species associated with wide forests, e. g. the Ouvea Parakeet, while others are typical of the open settings. The threats onto this avifauna are mainly linked to habitat destruction and the impact of introduced species.

Despite the implementation of trauma systems for improved coordination and organization of care, rehabilitation services are not yet routinely considered integral to trauma care processes. Methods MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Allied and Complementary Medicine, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to May 2011 for randomized clinical trials, as well as observational studies, reporting outcomes of injured patients following multidisciplinary rehabilitation that addressed functional restoration and societal reintegration based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. Results No randomized and/or controlled clinical trials were identified. Fifteen observational studies involving 2386 participants with injuries were included. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach assessed methodological quality as \u2018poor\u2019 in all studies, with selection and observer bias. Although patients with low functional scores showed improvement after rehabilitation, they were unable to resume their pretrauma level of activity. Their functional ability was significantly associated with motor independence on admission and early acute rehabilitation, which contributed to a shorter hospital stay. Injury location, age, co-morbidity and education predicted long-term functional consequences. Trauma care systems were associated with reduced mortality. The gaps in evidence include: rehabilitation settings, components, intensity, duration and types of therapy, and long-term outcomes for survivors of multiple trauma. Conclusion Rehabilitation is an expensive resource and the evidence to support its justification is needed urgently. The issues in study design and research methodology in rehabilitation are challenging. Opportunities to prioritize trauma rehabilitation, disability management and social reintegration of multiple injury survivors are discussed.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Our purpose is to unveil the potential correlations between IDO2 status, clinical-pathological parameters, patients\u2019 prognosis, and the possible immunomodulatory functions in MTC. Methods Immunohistochemical expression levels of IDO2 were evaluated in the resected MTC surgical specimens and corresponding lymph nodes. CD4 + T cell infiltration was also evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis in the MTC tissues. The association of the IDO2 expression level with clinicopathologic characteristics, overall survival (OS)/recurrence-free survival (RFS), and CD4 + T cell infiltration were retrospectively investigated. Results High expression of IDO2 is closely associated with more aggressive clinicopathological features, such as multifocality, ETE, a higher pT stage and especially a higher pN stage. Moreover, a significant difference in RFS was observed between the IDO2-high and IDO2-low groups. IDO2 expression of lymph node tissues was significantly related to the metastasis status. Furthermore, we found that IDO2 expression is negatively correlated with CD4 + T cell infiltrations in MTC tissues. Conclusion The expression level of IDO2 is associated with aggressive characteristics and is predictive of poor prognosis in patients with MTC. Also, an interesting observation is that IDO2 involvement in MTC showed a moderate sexual dimorphism, of which female patients tend to be more affected by IDO2 status. Moreover, our results showed the potential immunomodulatory functions of IDO2. The close relationship between IDO2 and CD4 + T cell infiltration in the MTC microenvironment, together with its potential prognostic implications, makes it possible for IDO2 to serve as an alternative drug target in cancer immunotherapy and as a new prognostic tool.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0,

Blue-bunch wheatgrass (Agropyron spicatum) is the most ubiquitous, widely distributed native perennial where exotic annuals are a competitive problem. It can be found as an understory associate or in open stands.Secar is a cultivar, of A. spicatum developed in the Pacific Northwest. Unfortunately, the percent germination of secar seed has been found to be low.

Warnings displayed on alcohol bottles are an effective measure to inform people about these risks and have been put in place in France. However, the alcohol industry (AI) resisted this measure when it was introduced in 2007 and during an expansion project in 2018. This study aims to identify arguments used by the AI against warnings targeting pregnant women. Methods A documentary method was used to analyse these arguments disseminated by the AI and its partners (elected representatives of wine-producing regions, etc.) in the French mainstream press (the national, regional and specialised press) from 2000 to 2020 through the Europresse documentary database. A quantitative analysis (number and evolution of press articles, mapping of the actors of AI who expressed themselves) and an inductive thematic content analysis (analytical framework of the arguments identified) using NVivo Software were carried out. Results Among the 85 articles included in this study, a majority of the arguments used by the AI are against this measure. It argues that this measure (1) is a questionable measure because ineffective in changing behaviours, (2) will have counterproductive effects (on women and on the economy); and (3) there are other preferred alternatives than warnings (targeted prevention programs, etc.). A minority is nevertheless in favour of this measure. Among the actors who expressed themselves, a large majority comes from the winegrowing sector. Conclusions The analysis of these arguments will add new insights about AI lobbying against warnings, by analyzing the arguments over a 20 years period covering a failure and a success of industry lobbying. It will also be useful for public health advocacy to better counter this lobbying influence and these arguments, which are not necessarily evidence based.

This semi-parametric model is capable to detect and duplicate non-linearities observed in the evolution of log-forces of mortality. The method proceeds in two steps. During the first stage, a neural-network-based generalization of the principal component analysis summarizes the information carried by the surface of log-mortality rates in a small number of latent factors. In the second step, these latent factors are forecast with an econometric model. The term structure of log-forces of mortality is next reconstructed by an inverse transformation. The neural analyzer is adjusted to French, UK and US mortality rates, over the period 1946\u20132000 and validated with data from 2001 to 2014. Numerical experiments reveal that the neural approach has an excellent predictive power, compared to the Lee\u2013Carter model with and without cohort effects.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

population was developed using two distinct Japanese quail strains, wild and white, to map quantitative trait loci underlying hatching weight and growth traits. Eight pairs of white and wild birds were crossed reciprocally and 34 F1 birds were produced. The F1 birds were intercrossed to generate 422 F2 offspring. All of the animals from three generations (472 birds) were genotyped for eight microsatellite markers on chromosome 1. Liveweight data from hatch to 5 weeks of age were collected on the F2 birds. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis was conducted applying the line-cross model and the least-squares interval mapping approach. The results indicated QTL affecting hatching weight and several growth related traits on chromosome 1. The F2 phenotypic variance explained by the detected additive QTL effects ranged from 1.0 to 3.7 for different traits.

We investigated whether vitamin B6, B12, and folate have an effect on brain structure, especially among depressed people who follow a specific diet. The study sample comprised 9426 participants from the UK Biobank cohort with a mean age of 62.4 years. A generalized linear model controlling for age, sex, body mass index, ethnicity, town send deprivation index, educational qualification, smoking, and alcohol intake was used to test the association between study groups and structural brain volumes. Depression was more prevalent, and intake of vitamin B6 and B12 was lower among vegetarians, while non-vegetarians had a lower intake of folate. Overall, no significant association was observed between vitamin B6, B12, and folate intakes and both global and subcortical brain volumes among participants with depression. However, vitamin B12 intake was positively associated with right pallidum among non-depressed participants, and a significant interaction between vitamin B12 intake and depression status on the right pallidum was observed. Also, a significant interaction between folate intake and depression status on grey matter (GM) volume and left thalamus was observed. Upon diet stratification, folate intake is associated with total brain volume and GM volume among vegetarians with depression. Furthermore, no significant associations were observed for subcortical regions. Our findings suggest that dietary intake of vitamin B6 and B12 might have an effect on brain structure.

However, in an actual engineering environment, only a tiny amount of unlabeled data can be collected. To solve this problem, we construct a spatio-temporal neural network (STN) model by multi-layer fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-term memory network features. Then, a model based on feature migration is constructed and a STN is applied as the feature extractor of the network. Finally, the Case Western Reserve University bearing dataset is employed to verify the performance of our proposed model, and the influence of different neural network feature extractors (CNN, recurrent neural network, long- and short-term memory network, STN) and several feature transfer measures [correlation alignment, multiple kernel maximum mean discrepancy, joint maximum mean discrepancy, discriminative joint probability maximum mean discrepancy (DJP-MMD) on the accuracy of the model were compared. The results show that the diagnostic accuracy of the proposed method is over 98%, and the diagnostic accuracy can be maintained at around 99% in most cases when the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is 10 dB. When the SNR is lower than 2 dB, the accuracy of the STN-DJPMMD model is still over 88%.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Mechanical Engineering\"]", "language": "en", "length": [92, 0, 1889], "string": "title={High Resolution Heat Transfer Measurement on Flat and Contoured Endwalls in a Linear Cascade}, container_title={}, abstract={In order to continue increasing the efficiency of gas turbines, a significant effort is being made to reduce losses induced by secondary flows in turbine stages. In addition to their impact on aerodynamic losses, these vortical structures are also the source of large heat transfer variations across the passage. A substantial reduction of the secondary flow losses can be achieved with a contoured endwall. However, a change in the vortical pattern can dramatically impact the thermal loads on the endwalls and lead to higher cooling requirements in those areas. This paper focuses on heat transfer measurements made in a passage with either flat or contoured endwalls. The experimental data are supplemented with numerical predictions of the heat transfer data. The measurements are carried out on an isothermal endwall equipped with symmetric airfoils. The paper presents measurements at M = 0.3, corresponding to a Reynolds number ReCax=4.6\u00d7105. An infrared camera is used to provide high-resolution surface temperature data on the endwall. The surface is equipped with an insulating layer (Kapton), allowing the calculation of heat flux through the endwall. The heat transfer quantities, namely the heat transfer coefficient and the adiabatic wall temperature, are then derived from a set of measurements at different isothermal plate temperatures. The numerical predictions clarify the link between the change in the heat transfer quantities and the changes in the flow field due to endwall contouring. Finally, numerically predicted heat transfer data are deduced from a set of adiabatic and diabatic simulations that are compared to the experimental data. The comparison focuses on the differences in the regions with endwall contouring, where a significant difference in the heat transfer coefficient between flat and contoured endwalls is measured but underpredicted numerically.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Psychiatry and Mental Health\"]", "language": "en", "length": [44, 0, 0], "string": "title={PSYCHIC, NEUROLOGICAL AND AUTONOMIC SYMPTOMS}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Plant Science\", \"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics\", \"Plant Science\", \"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [89, 0, 0], "string": "title={Pollen morphology of Callicarpa L.

The correlation of the genetic antibiotic resistance markers to antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST)}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Background Antibiotic resistant infections are a risk for increased patient mortality due to long time-to-results for current diagnostic methods. Results from a \u223c1,500 patient trial demonstrated bacterial blood culture required 51 hours on average for a positive result. Current antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) requires two additional days for phenotypic results. Studies show delays in effective treatment increases mortality rates by 7.6% every hour. The CDC classifies carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (13,000 annual deaths) as urgent threats, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (\u223c15,000 annual deaths combined) as serious threats. Identifying resistance markers direct from patient samples may aid clinical decisions, reduce antibiotic use, reduce time to effective therapy, and improve patient outcomes Methods 200 antibiotic resistant bacterial strains were genotyped for 13 clinically-relevant resistance genes and screened for antibiotic resistance phenotypes. Results identified correlations between resistance markers and phenotypic resistance and potential aid for clinical treatment. Results High resistance to vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, first-line antibiotics, were seen in 48 Gram-positive and 69 Gram-negative strains. Presence of Gram-positive markers vanA or vanB correlated to 100% (28/28) vancomycin resistance and 88% (25/28) ampicillin resistance. In 85 sequenced Gram-negative strains, 35 harbored metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (blaIMP,blaNDM,blaVIM), 35 contained extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (blaCTX-M-14,blaCTX-M-15), 21 contained AmpC \u03b2-lactamase (blaDHA,blaCMY), and 34 contained carbapenenase (blaKPC,blaOXA48). These markers correlated to 100% resistance to ampicillin, cefazolin, and cefuroxime in all strains. Conclusion Together, these data suggest that molecular diagnostics that identify genetic markers may provide clinicians with needed information during a window when therapeutic intervention can improve patient outcomes.

Consequences of Twentieth Century US Farming}, container_title={Annual Review of Sociology}, abstract={\u25aa Abstract One of the most profound changes in the United States in the past century is the national abandonment of farming as a livelihood strategy. This change is evident both in the exodus of Americans from farming and in the conditions faced by the farmers remaining, most of whom are marginal producers in an increasingly concentrated industry. In this article, we provide a retrospective account of the empirical and sociological fate of family farmers. While sociologists have had longstanding interest in agrarian change, research on contemporary farmers is largely confined to speciality publications, with a loss to the discipline at large. We examine three distinct research traditions that continue to document farm transformation: research on macro-level transformation, community impacts, and household response. While these traditions evolved separately, we describe how they overlap and inform each other. Most notably, research on household and community responses delineates meso- and micro-level institutional factors that extend macro-level theory. Research on the contemporary farm population offers an alternative context in which to interrogate conventional accounts of economic development; such research yields insights about aspects of social life being rediscovered as part of the new economy and continues to pull sociologists into politically charged public policy debates.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cell Biology\", \"Genetics\", \"Molecular Biology\", \"Biochemistry\", \"Structural Biology\", \"Biophysics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [135, 0, 0], "string": "title={Introduction of BAPTA into intact rat submandibular acini inhibits mucin secretion in response to cholinergic and \u03b2-adrenergic agonists}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Ecology\", \"Forestry\", \"Global and Planetary Change\"]", "language": "en", "length": [97, 0, 1618], "string": "title={The impacts of changes in federal timber harvest on forest carbon sequestration in western Oregon}, container_title={}, abstract={This study examines the potential impacts of changes in federal timber harvest, acting through regional log markets, on the sequestration of carbon in forests and forest products in western Oregon. We construct a dynamic model of the region\u2019s log markets in which market prices, log consumption at mills, and timber harvests and timber inventories on private, federal, and state forests are endogenous. Absent any policies regulating forest carbon sequestration, simulations show that regional carbon flux in forests and forest products would gradually decline as federal harvest rises from recent historical levels. If regional forest carbon flux were constrained to meet some minimum target, however, projections indicate that there would be opportunities for substituting carbon sequestration between federal and nonfederal lands through coordination of harvests across ownerships. We find that relatively small reductions in average private harvest could offset substantial losses of carbon flux on federal timberlands caused by increased federal harvest. One mechanism for achieving the changes needed in private harvest to meet a regional carbon flux target would be a carbon tax/subsidy program or a carbon offset market. For example, if federal owners offered timber for sale equal to the maximum sustainable level under the Northwest Forest Plan, our analysis indicates that a carbon price of roughly $US 19 per tonne of carbon would be sufficient to induce private owners to undertake the harvest and management modifications necessary to maintain regional forest carbon flux at its level in the early 2000s.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis\", \"Toxicology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [28, 0, 0], "string": "title={Acknowledgements to referees}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cell Biology\", \"Developmental Biology\", \"Embryology\", \"Anatomy\", \"Anatomy\"]", "language": "en", "length": [88, 22, 0], "string": "title={The organization of serotonin fibers in the anterior column of the mammalian spinal cord}, container_title={Anatomy and Embryology}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine\", \"Surgery\"]", "language": "de", "length": [160, 0, 1713], "string": "title={Versorgungsrealit\u00e4t in Deutschland: ein Auszug aus dem Schulterendoprothesenregister der Deutschen Vereinigung f\u00fcr Schulter- und Ellenbogenchirurgie e.V.

Die Registerforschung bietet die M\u00f6glichkeit, Trends in der Versorgung im Hinblick auf die demografischen Daten als auch der verwendeten Implantate fr\u00fchzeitig zu erkennen und sichtbar zu machen. Material und Methode Die Daten des Schulterendoprothesenregister SPR der DVSE aus den Jahren 2015\u20132020 f\u00fcr alle Prim\u00e4rimplantationen wurden retrospektiv ausgewertet im Hinblick auf folgende Parameter: demografische Faktoren, Verwendung von Implantaten (anatomisch vs. invers; zementiert vs. zementfrei; schaftfrei, Kurzsch\u00e4ften, klassische Sch\u00e4fte), Anzahl der dokumentierenden Kliniken/Abteilungen w\u00e4hrend dieses Zeitraums. Ergebnisse Es zeigt sich ein Anstieg der dokumentierten F\u00e4lle im SPR \u00fcber die Jahre (vor allem Zunahme inverser Endoprothesen). Ursache f\u00fcr die Fallzahlsteigerungen ist keine relevante Abnahme des Durchschnittsalters zum Zeitpunkt der Erstimplantation. Bei Implantation von anatomischen Endoprothesen zeigt sich ein klarer Trend zugunsten der Verwendung von schaftfreien Implantaten; schaftfreie inverse Implantate bleiben eher die Ausnahme; Glenoide werden \u00fcberwiegend zementiert mit leicht fallendem Trend, humerale Komponenten werden weiterhin \u00fcberwiegend zementiert implantiert, etwas weniger ausgepr\u00e4gt auch bei inversen Endoprothesen. Schlussfolgerung Die Daten belegen, dass die Fallzahlsteigerung der Implantationen nicht auf eine Ausweitung der Indikation f\u00fcr j\u00fcngere Patienten zur\u00fcckgef\u00fchrt werden kann.

Materials and Methods: Dextromethorphan (DEX) was used as a probe for measuring metabolic activity, based on its CYP2D6- and CYP3A4-mediated metabolism to dextrorphan (DOR) and 3-methoxymorphinan (3-MM), respectively. For the in vitro investigations, DEX (25\u00b5M) was incubated with human liver microsomes and NADPH and tested with and without the fenugreek extract. For the in vivo study, phase I, 6 subjects received a single dose of DEX (30 mg); in phase II, after washout period, the fenugreek seeds powder was administered for 1 week and DEX was administered with its last dose. Results: In vitro, fenugreek extract inhibits CYP2D6-mediated O-demethylation of DEX. Higher concentrations (50 and 100\u00b5g/ml) of extract inhibit CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activity. In vivo results indicated that fenugreek does not significantly inhibit CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 metabolic activity. There was no significant change in the levels of DEX metabolites (DOR 12% and 3-MM 9%) excreted in urine and their urine metabolic ratios (P values: 0.257 and 0.333 DEX/DOR and DEX/3-MM, respectively).

This study thereby provides insight into how and why adult children cross the line into the realm of misconduct. Design/methodology/approach The approach involved a review of various court proceedings relating to elder financial abuse, and the synthesis of the important facts and judgements made that constitute unconscionable conduct, undue influence and passive acceptance of benefit. The cases selected focus on real estate transactions. Findings The research revealed some key commonalities and that property and living arrangements are the issues highly contested in courts for small estates. Practical implications The case review provides some critical findings that are valuable for wealth management professionals or managing an ageing person\u2019s care and living arrangements. It provides practical insights for the importance of independent legal and financial advice when entering real estate transactions. The findings also inform real estate agent practice in helping to reduce elder financial abuse through robust checks if an Attorney is acting on behalf of a Principal. The authors also support improving EPoA guidance and professionalization to assist Attorney\u2019s to carry out their duties with appropriate care. Originality/value A review of cases relating to EPoA in relation to real estate is novel and makes an important contribution to developing resources to educate Attorney\u2019s and financial service

Using a comparative analysis of a wide range of French sources and Arab chronicles, the author comes to the conclusion that Bonaparte&apos;s attempt at an inter-civilizational dialogue with the Muslim population of Egypt ended in complete failure. Based on the stereotypical ideas about the Orient, common in the French literature of the Enlightenment, Napoleon tried to play in Egypt the same role that, according to the French philosophers, the Prophet Muhammad allegedly played in his time, namely, to take advantage of the \u201ccredulity\u201d and \u201csuperstition\u201d of the local population to subordinate it to his power. However, the Egyptians were very skeptical concerning Bonaparte&apos;s claims about the French army&apos;s commitment to Islam and his attempts to present himself as the Mahdi, the prophet of the last times. The daily practices of the occupiers, which openly contradicted the culture of Islam, completely alienated the Muslims from the French, which resulted not only in their mutual misunderstanding, but also in real hatred for each other.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

VAMP2 mRNA was higher in MD compared to AD (p = 0.0013) and CT (p = 0.0017), and in MCI-MD compared to MCI-AD (p &lt; 0.001) after correcting for age, gender, MMSE and ApoE4 +/\u2212 covariates (pc = 0.004). A higher VAMP2 expression was observed in subjects carrying the minor allele Del compared to those carrying the Ins/Ins genotype (p = 0.012). Finally, Del/Del genotype was more frequently carried by MD/MCI-MD compared to CT (pc = 0.036). These results suggest that VAMP2 mRNA expression can discriminate mixed form of dementia from AD, possibly being a biomarker of AD evolution in MCI patients.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

(C57BL/6J \u00d7 A/J) F1 hybrids (B6A), but not in C57BL/6J (B6) mice. Previously, using quantitative trait locus (QTL) linkage analysis, we showed that D3Tx-AOD is controlled by five unlinked QTL (Aod1-Aod5) and H2. In this study, using D3Tx B6-ChrA/J/NaJ chromosome (Chr) substitution strains, we confirm that QTL on Chr16 (Aod1a/Aod1b), Chr3 (Aod2), Chr1 (Aod3), Chr2 (Aod4), Chr7 (Aod5), and Chr17 (H2) control D3Tx-AOD susceptibility. In addition, we also present data mapping QTL controlling D3Tx-ADA to Chr17 (Ada1/H2), Chr1 (Ada2), and Chr3 (Ada3). Importantly, B6-ChrXA/J mice were as resistant to D3Tx-AOD and D3Tx-ADA as B6 mice, thereby excluding Foxp3 as a susceptibility gene in these models. Moreover, we report quantitative differences in the frequency of nTregs in the lymph nodes (LNs), but not spleen or thymus, of AOD/ADA-resistant B6 and AOD/ADA-susceptible A/J, B6A, and B6-Chr17A/J mice. Similar results correlating with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and orchitis susceptibility were seen with B10.S and SJL/J mice. Using H2-congenic mice, we show that the observed difference in frequency of LN nTregs is controlled by Ada1/H2. These data support the existence of an LN-specific, H2-controlled mechanism regulating the prevalence of nTregs in autoimmune disease susceptibility.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Literature and Literary Theory\", \"Linguistics and Language\", \"Archeology\", \"Visual Arts and Performing Arts\", \"Language and Linguistics\", \"Archeology\", \"Classics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [24, 31, 2044], "string": "title={No Flames in the Odyssey}, container_title={The Journal of Hellenic Studies}, abstract={In one of the most stimulating chapters of his recent contribution to Homeric studies, Professor D. L. Page adduces considerable evidence to suggest that the traditions of the Iliad and the Odyssey diverged at a fairly early date and, like isolated dialects, came to differ appreciably in their diction. Attractive and probable as this suggestion is as a whole, it will always be possible to wonder about the details of the evidence. In this paper it is intended to wonder whether the absence of \u03c6\u03bb\u03cc\u03be and its cognates from that part of the Odyssey that is certainly \u2018Homer's\u2019 is rightly adduced as evidence for this divergence of the traditions.Page's argument runs as follows. The absence of \u03c6\u03bb\u03cc\u03be must be due either to ignorance or to chance. But it cannot be due to chance, since there are more than fifty opportunities for its use. Therefore the root, so common in the Iliad, must have been \u2018wholly unknown to the Odyssean poet\u2019.It appears that in order to show that \u03c6\u03bb\u03cc\u03be was not part of the Odyssey's traditional vocabulary, since it is this that diverges from the Iliad, Page must claim that the root was not part of the poet's vocabulary at all. Can this be regarded as a probable claim? Our available evidence is scarcely sufficient to differentiate the sub-dialects of Ionic (it is admitted that both poets are Ionians), so that it is impossible to confirm that differences of nontechnical vocabulary were a feature of the differentiation. Our view of the matter has therefore to depend on a subjective estimate of the probabilities. Two points are not unworthy of notice: first, the banishing of \u03c6\u03bb\u03cc\u03be from the Odyssey is only achieved by the attribution to a rhapsodic hack of the \u2018Continuation\u2019, where in \u03c9 71, \u03c6\u03bb\u03cc\u03be appears in just the circumstances where, as I hope to show, it is to be expected; and second, derivatives of the root are used by prose and verse writers both Ionian and Attic, and also in the \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03ae, in circumstances that make it impossible to suppose that every instance is a reminiscence of a long defunct epic word.}",

Fumarate accumulation results in activation of stress-related mechanisms leading to upregulation of cell survival-related genes. To better understand how cells compensate for the loss of FH in HLRCC, we determined the amino acid nutrient requirements of the FH-deficient UOK262 cell line (UOK262) and its FH-repleted control (UOK262WT).MethodsWe determined growth rates and survival of cell lines in response to amino acid depletion and supplementation. RNAseq was used to determine the transcription changes contingent on Asn and Gln supplementation, which was further followed with stable isotope resolved metabolomics (SIRM) using both [U-13C,15N] Gln and Asn.ResultsWe found that Asn increased the growth rate of both cell lines in vitro. Gln, but not Asn, increased oxygen consumption rates and glycolytic reserve of both cell lines. Although Asn was taken up by the cells, there was little evidence of Asn-derived label in cellular metabolites, indicating that Asn was not catabolized. However, Asn strongly stimulated Gln labeling of uracil and precursors, uridine phosphates and hexosamine metabolites in the UOK262 cells and to a much lesser extent in the UOK262WT cells, indicating an activation of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) by Asn. Asn in combination with Gln, but not Asn or Gln alone, stimulated expression of genes associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) in UOK262 to a greater extent than in FH-restored cells. The changes in expression of these genes were confirmed by RT-PCR, and the stimulation of the UPR was confirmed orthogonally by demonstration of an increase in spliced XBP1 (sXBP1) in UOK262 cells under these conditions. Asn exposure also increased both the RNA and protein expression of the HBP regulator GFPT2, which is a transcriptional target of sXBP1.ConclusionsAsn in the presence of Gln induces an ER stress response in FH-deficient UOK262 cells and stimulates increased synthesis of UDP-acetyl glycans indicative of HBP activity. These data demonstrate a novel effect of asparagine on cellular metabolism in FH-deficient cells that could be exploited therapeutically.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Periodontics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [31, 0, 0], "string": "title={The Prevention Of Periodontitis}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [87, 28, 0], "string": "title={Statistically significant or clinically useful?

It puts forward the idea that, rather than an outcome of Indonesian democratisation, this stream was in fact the product of authoritarian New Order rule. The article also considers some parallels in the trajectories of political Islam more generally in Indonesia, the Middle East and North Africa, especially as a kind of populist response to the tensions and contradictions of global capitalism. It addresses the city of Surakarta (Solo) as a case study and highlights the importance of Cold War politics in moulding political Islam in Indonesia and elsewhere. The approach emphasises historical and sociological factors shaping political Islam that have tended to be relegated to the background in prevalent security-oriented analyses concerned with issues of terrorism and violence.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cell Biology\", \"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience\", \"Pharmacology\", \"Molecular Biology\", \"Molecular Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [52, 0, 0], "string": "title={Mechanisms involved in hematopoietic stem cell aging}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Obstetrics and Gynecology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [14, 0, 0], "string": "title={Author's Reply}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Economics and Econometrics\", \"Geography, Planning and Development\"]", "language": "en", "length": [28, 0, 0], "string": "title={Ski Geography of New England}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Nuclear and High Energy Physics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [78, 0, 0], "string": "title={Photon linear colliders as Aladdin's lamp -

In view of their potential dietary significance, the validated method was applied to survey the influence of species, season, and lactation on their contribution to the nonprotein nitrogen pool in milk. Mature bovine milk contained orotic acid, uric acid, and creatinine in the range of 30\u201370, 9\u201324, and 6\u201312 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. Although uric acid and creatinine were present in all milks, orotic acid was essentially absent in nonruminant milks. In contrast to urate and creatinine, expression of orotic acid in bovine milk was strongly dependent on stage of early lactation. The co-existence in mammalian milks of related nucleoside and nucleotide components was also determined.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

CORRELATION WITH VASCULAR INVOLVEMENT}, container_title={Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases}, abstract={Background:Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma, SSc) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by multi-organ dysfunction, which ultimately leads to multiple clinical and psychological complications. Among various complications of scleroderma, sexual dysfunction can be named as a major issue in both male and female patients, which has great impact on quality of life of the patients.Objectives:Investigating the sexual dysfunction in scleroderma patients and its relation to their vascular involvements.Methods:A case control study was done on 80 married female scleroderma patients with age between 20-60 years old. Eighty normal individuals adjusted for age, place of living and socioeconomic status were also recruited. Sexual performance in both groups was assessed using FSFI standardized questionnaire, which evaluated it in 6 domains of desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. Micro and macro-vascular involvements of the patients were also determined using Raynaud Condition Score, Echocardiography, physical exam for assessing their digital ulcers and reviewing their medical records for presence of past or present history of renal crisis and thromboembolic events.Results:The total score of FSFI in the case group was significantly lower compared to control one (16.68 \u00b1 6.35, 19.69 \u00b1 6.01, P-value Conclusion:This study can be named as the first survey investigating the sexual dysfunction in Iranian female scleroderma patients and assessing its relation with vascular complication of the disease. Thus, it can be a guide for future studies on sexual dysfunction especially in societies with cultural limitations in discussing this issue.References:[1]Bruni C, Raja J, Denton CP, Matucci-Cerinic M.

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has demonstrated both short- and long-term efficacy with small to medium effect sizes for PPS, with larger treatment effects for specific PPS syndromes, including non-cardiac chest pain, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Research indicates that PPS conditions share similar cognitive and behavioural responses to symptoms, such as avoidance and unhelpful beliefs. This suggests that a transdiagnostic approach may be beneficial for patients with PPS. Methods A randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a transdiagnostic CBT-based intervention for PPS. 322 participants with PPS will be recruited from secondary care clinics. Participants stratified by clinic and disability level will be randomised to CBT plus standard medical care (SMC) versus SMC alone. The intervention consists of 8 CBT sessions delivered by a qualified therapist over a period of 20 weeks. Outcomes will be assessed at 9, 20, 40- and 52-weeks post randomisation. Efficacy will be assessed by examining the difference between arms in the primary outcome Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) at 52 weeks after randomisation. Secondary outcomes will include mood, symptom severity and clinical global impression at 9, 20, 40 and 52 weeks. Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated by combining measures of health service use, informal care, loss of working hours and financial benefits at 52 weeks. Discussion This trial will provide a powered evaluation of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a transdiagnostic CBT approach versus SMC for patients with PPS. It will also provide valuable information about potential healthcare pathways for patients with PPS within the National Health Service (NHS). Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02426788.

Last but not least, we propose a systematic policy to win the war against cancer that is a big challenge to science.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Polymers and Plastics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [59, 0, 0], "string": "title={A Study on Post-colonialism in Lee Kwang-woong's literature}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Transplantation\", \"Nephrology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [131, 0, 0], "string": "title={Increased urinary losses of carnitine and decreased intramitochondrial coenzyme A in gentamicin-induced acute renal failure in rats}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Nutrition and Dietetics\", \"Medicine (miscellaneous)\"]", "language": "en", "length": [189, 42, 0], "string": "title={Alterations in growth and body composition during puberty.

The coupling provides a novel approach to studying random-graph epidemic models.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [115, 0, 0], "string": "title={Generation of mode-locked optical pulses at 1035 nm from a fiber Bragg grating stabilized semiconductor laser diode}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Aquatic Science\"]", "language": "en", "length": [81, 0, 0], "string": "title={Unprecedented longevity of unharvested shallow-water snappers in the Indian Ocean}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Neurology (clinical)\", \"Surgery\"]", "language": "en", "length": [70, 12, 205], "string": "title={Epidural Myxoma Causing Compression of the Cauda Equina: A Case Report}, container_title={Neurosurgery}, abstract={Abstract A unique case of a patient with an epidural myxoma arising at L-3, L-4 presented with a history mimicking lumbar spinal stenosis.

metabolism of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) composing Aroclor 1254\u00ae is determined principally by chlorine substitution patterns rather than degree of chlorination. Rapidly metabolized PCBs have 2,3, 3,4, or 2,3,6 chlorine substitution on at least one phenyl ring. Those PCBs which are not metabolized have a combination of 2,4,5, 2,3,4, and 2,3,4,5 chlorine substitutions on both rings. PCBs containing 2,5 substitutions were metabolized over a 31 day period, but much more slowly than PCBs with 2,3 or 3,4 chlorine substitutions.Chemical structure of PCBs does not affect their rate of mobilization from adipose tissue and subsequent movement through the circulation. The fractional turnover of all PCBs is approximately equivalent to the fractional turnover of the lipid pool under fully fed conditions as well as during periods of starvation induced depletion of lipid reserves. A net movement of PCBs from adipocytes to other lipid pools, principally muscle cells, occurred during starvation. On subsequent refeeding, the net movement of PCBs from muscle back into adipose tissue was similar to the net movement out of adipose tissue. PCB metabolites tend to be rapidly excreted and do not accumulate in adipose tissue, muscle, or liver. Brain and, to a lesser extent, kidney tissue appear to accumulate PCB metabolites, particularly during the refeeding stage in a starvation/refeeding cycle.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Space and Planetary Science\", \"Astronomy and Astrophysics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [61, 0, 0], "string": "title={A SYMMETRIC INNER CAVITY IN THE HD 141569A CIRCUMSTELLAR DISK}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics\", \"Statistical and Nonlinear Physics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [102, 43, 678], "string": "title={Quantum phase transition of a finite number of atoms in electromagnetically induced transparency media}, container_title={Journal of the Optical Society of America B}, abstract={Instead of an infinite number of atoms in the thermodynamic limit, we study the ground states of a finite number of three-level atoms in electromagnetically induced transparency media.

The results derived in this work provide the connection not only to the Dicke model, but also to the Lipkin\u2013Meshkov\u2013Glick model.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation\", \"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [125, 0, 0], "string": "title={Hip Joint Effusion-Synovitis Is Associated With Hip Pain and Sports/Recreation Function in Female Professional Ballet Dancers}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Sociology and Political Science\"]", "language": "en", "length": [271, 0, 0], "string": "title={Stealth Democracy: Americans\u2019 Beliefs about How Government Should WorkStealth Democracy: Americans\u2019 Beliefs about How Government Should Work.

zweier elektronischer Erhebungsinstrumente waren. Die so konstruierten Frageb\u00f6gen wurden im Rahmen einer quantitativen Querschnittsstudie an einem Stichtag per Email an die Mitarbeitenden der M\u00fcnchner Sucht- und Altenhilfe versendet.Im Rahmen beider Untersuchungsschritte wurde insbesondere deutlich, dass das Thema Alter bzw. Pflegebed\u00fcrftigkeit und der Konsum illegaler Drogen bislang in der Suchthilfe eine deutlich gr\u00f6\u00dfere Bedeutung erf\u00e4hrt als in der Altenhilfe. Im Rahmen der Fragebogenerhebung zeigte sich zudem ein in beiden Hilfesystemen bestehender Bedarf an gegenseitigem Austausch und wechselseitiger Unterst\u00fctzung sowie Interesse an Informationen und Fortbildungen. Das bisherige Regularium der Substitutionsbehandlung wurde in beiden Hilfesystemen als Problem benannt.Aufgrund geringer Fallzahlen von Drogenkonsumenten im Altenhilfesystem ist derzeit (noch) davon auszugehen, dass die Thematik \u201eAbh\u00e4ngigkeit von illegalen Substanzen\u201c dort nicht explizit, sondern h\u00f6chstens im Kontext legaler Drogen aufgegriffen wird. Nachdem die Zielgruppe somit auch weiterhin schwerpunktm\u00e4\u00dfig in der Suchthilfe betreut werden wird, sind Fortbildungsangebote zu alters- und pflegerelevanten Themen, sowie der Ausbau bedarfsgerechter Versorgungskonzepte (z.

The full effects of EHR use on physician-patient interactions remain unclear. This study aims to compare patient perception of physician\u2019s compassion, communication skills, and professionalism between a traditional face to face clinic visit with a visit where an examination room computer is used by the physician to access and document patient information. Methods: RCT was conducted at an outpatient supportive care center. 120 English speaking adults with advanced cancer were recruited. Patients were randomized to watch 2 standardized, 3-minute video vignettes depicting a routine physician-patient clinical encounter. Both videos had identical script. In one video, physician communicated face to face while in the other video physician used the examination room computer during conversation. Both actors and patients were blinded to the purpose of the study. Investigators were blinded to the sequence of videos watched by the patients. After viewing each video, patients completed validated questionnaires rating their perception of physician\u2019s compassion (0 = best, 50 = worst), communication skills (0 = poor, 70 = excellent) and professionalism (0 = poor, 20 = very good). Patients were also asked to rate their overall physician preference. Results: After watching the first video, the face to face clinical encounter resulted in better compassion scores (median [interquartile range], 9[0-18] vs 20[6-28]; P = .0003), communication skills 65[54-70] vs 54[41-63]; P = .0001) and professionalism 19[5-20] vs 14[11-17]; P = .013). After crossover analysis, we found a significant period ( P = .004) and sequence ( P = .005) effect favoring the second video on compassion scores. After watching the second video, 86 (72%) of the patients preferred face to face communication. Conclusions: Patientsperceived physicians who communicated face to face without the use of computer as more compassionate, professional and with better communication skills. Moreover they preferred face to face physician to be their provider.

Neurophysiological signals across different spatial and temporal scales provide insight into neural communication. However, additional methodological considerations arise when investigating network-wide brain dynamics rather than local effects. Specifically, larger amounts of data, investigated across a higher dimensional space, are necessary. Here, we present FiNN (Find Neurophysiological Networks), a novel toolbox for the analysis of neurophysiological data with a focus on functional and effective connectivity. FiNN provides a wide range of data processing methods and statistical and visualization tools to facilitate inspection of connectivity estimates and the resulting metrics of brain dynamics. The Python toolbox and its documentation are freely available as Supporting Information. We evaluated FiNN against a number of established frameworks on both a conceptual and an implementation level. We found FiNN to require much less processing time and memory than other toolboxes. In addition, FiNN adheres to a design philosophy of easy access and modifiability, while providing efficient data processing implementations. Since the investigation of network-level neural dynamics is experiencing increasing interest, we place FiNN at the disposal of the neuroscientific community as open-source software.}",

The bacterial communities of two onshore seepage sites were analysed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing; the geochemical characteristics, hydrocarbon content, and the carbon isotope composition of the sites were also determined. While one site was found to be characterised by biogenic origin of methane gas, with a carbon isotope ratio (\u03b413C (\u2030)) of \u221263.2, high contents of organic matter and complex hydrocarbons, the other site showed a mixed origin of the methane gas (\u03b413C (\u2030) = \u221226.6) with geothermal characteristics and lower organic matter content. While both sites harboured Proteobacteria as the most abundant bacterial phyla, the Deltaproteobacteria were more abundant at the geothermal site and the Alphaproteobacteria at the biogenic site. The Dehalococcoidia class of phylum Chloroflexi was abundant at the geothermal site while the Anaerolineae class was more abundant at the biogenic site. Bacterial strains from the seepage pockmarks were isolated on a variety of selective media targeting bacteria with bioremediation potential. A total of 106 strains were isolated and characterised, including representatives from the phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria.

Drawing on the neo-materialist perspective, we examine whether the longitudinal association between income inequality and life expectancy is mediated and moderated by policy liberalism in U.S. states (2000\u20132014). More liberal policy contexts are characterized by greater efforts to regulate the economy, redistribute income, and protect vulnerable groups and lesser efforts to penalize deviant social behavior. We find that state-level income inequality is inversely associated with policy liberalism and life expectancy. The association between income inequality and life expectancy was not mediated by policy liberalism but was moderated by it. The association is attenuated in states with more liberal policy contexts, supporting the neo-materialist perspective. This finding illustrates how states like New York and California (with liberal policy contexts) can exhibit high income inequality and high life expectancy.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

The sample comprises of 70 Indonesian digital MSP businesses that have been operational for at least three years and have used open innovation approaches with their audiences, communities or complementors.FindingsThe research findings imply that there is a connection between promotion-focused effectuation and the open innovation process. This connection is particularly strong when it comes to the incorporation of absorptive capacity and crowds or communities management practices. On the other hand, prevention-focused effectuation shows insignificant effect toward open innovation process in digital MSP startups context.Research limitations/implicationsThe research findings imply that with limited resources and experiences, young entrepreneurs can still implement open innovation strategy for their digital MSP platform through effectuation principles that leverage the external resources from digital platform ecosystem members.Practical implicationsIn digital MSP startups context that perform promotion-based effectuation principles, innovation performance can be achieved by analyzing new insight, transforming the existing activities with the new insight, creating new offering afterward, as well as strengthening crowds or communities management practices through co-creation activities with platform ecosystem members that may lead into new business model.Originality/valueThe originality of this work is to make a contribution to the literature on strategic entrepreneurship by describing the phenomena of the paradox of resource-based theory; adopting open innovation strategy under constrained initial resources and capabilities scenario.}",

Surgery}, abstract={Abstract Purpose Previous studies showed that patients with lower weight loss after bariatric surgery could be identified based on early postoperative weight loss. However, these studies had only 12\u201336-month follow-up. This study aimed to explore whether patients in the lowest weight loss quartile at 3 months had lower weight loss trajectories up to 5 years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), banded Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (BRYGB), and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) surgery. Methods Weight was assessed preoperatively, and 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months postoperatively. Patients were grouped into four categories based on quartiles of percentage total weight loss (%TWL) at 3-month follow-up. Results were compared between the lowest %TWL quartile group and other quartile groups. Results Patients underwent either RYGB (n=13,106; 72%), SG (n=3585; 20%), or BRYGB (n=1391, 8%) surgery. Weight loss trajectories of patients in the lowest %TWL quartile group remained lower than that of other quartile groups throughout a 5-year follow-up, for all three types of surgery. Patients in the lowest %TWL quartile group had higher age at surgery, higher baseline BMI, and were more likely to be male (in the SG group), and to suffer from diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and osteoarthritis. Conclusion This study showed a positive association between weight loss at 3 and 12 to 60 months after bariatric surgery. Weight loss at 3 months after surgery could be used to identify patients whose anticipated weight loss trajectories are below average, to potentially improve their outcomes through early behavioral or medical interventions.

abstract={Summary Addax Petroleum's operated Okwori oil field, offshore Nigeria, illustrated the benefits of reviving shelved projects, because of an insufficient return on investment using more traditional approaches, by applying more recent technical and contractual solutions. The Okwori project demonstrated the feasibility of developing small and geologically complex offshore oil fields in medium water depth of 440 ft with subsea technologies traditionally used for large fields. In the subsurface, the Okwori wells combined multiple selective completions hydraulically controlled from the surface with expandable sand screens as the downhole sand exclusion solution. This combination of equipment in subsea wells used to fully develop a small offshore oil field marked another technological first in Nigeria. Far away from pre-existing facilities and with less than 50 million bbl of median technical reserves at the time of project sanction, the Okwori oilfield development went a step further than the more usual subsea tieback to a pre-existing offshore production facility. The Okwori development plan was based on horizontal subsea trees flowing to a leased spread-moored floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel by means of (6-in.) flexible subsea flowlines and risers. The Okwori leased production facilities had a built-in capability for additional tiebacks such as the Nda oil field, whose development was completed in October 2006, or for later redeployment in other parts of the acreage depending on further exploration and appraisal drilling. A review of the field operations to date highlighted a steep learning curve in the formulation of completion design, completion fluids, stimulation, downhole sand exclusion systems, and bean-up/bean-down procedures.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

losses and waste reduction are a worldwide challenge involving governments, researchers, and food industries. Therefore, by-product revalorization and the use of key extracted biocompounds to fortify innovative foods seems an interesting challenge to afford. The aim of this review is to evaluate and elucidate the scientific evidence on the use of green technologies to extract bioactive compounds from Brassica by-products with potential application in developing new foods. Scopus was used to search for indexed studies in JCR-ISI journals, while books, reviews, and non-indexed JCR journals were excluded. Broccoli, kale, cauliflower, cabbage, mustard, and radish, among others, have been deeply reviewed. Ultrasound and microwave-assisted extraction have been mostly used, but there are relevant studies using enzymes, supercritical fluids, ultrafiltration, or pressurized liquids that report a great extraction effectiveness and efficiency. However, predictive models must be developed to optimize the extraction procedures. Extracted biocompounds can be used, free or encapsulated, to develop, reformulate, and/or fortify new foods as a good tool to enhance healthiness while preserving their quality (nutritional, functional, and sensory) and safety. In the age of recycling and energy saving, more studies must evaluate the efficiency of the processes, the cost, and the environmental impact leading to the production of new foods and the sustainable extraction of phytochemicals.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

BCL-2\u2013associated death promoter (BAD), integrates the common cell survival effects of the RAS/MEK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. Herein, it was observed that increased BADSer99 (BADS99) phosphorylation in EC cells was significantly associated with PTEN-deficient status. Forced expression of phosphorylation deficient human BADS99A in PTEN-deficient EC cells significantly increased CASPASE 3/7 activity and decreased EC cell viability. Using NPB as a pharmacological inhibitor of pBADS99 phosphorylation, it was demonstrated that NPB synergized with PARPis (Olaparib, Rucaparib and Talazoparib) to enhance PARPi IC50 up to 60-fold and decreased survival, foci formation, and growth in 3D ex vivo culture of PTEN-deficient EC cells. Combined NPB-PARPi treatment of PTEN-deficient EC cells stimulated apoptosis and promoted DNA damage by impairment of homologous recombination. Using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 endonuclease system it was demonstrated that deletion of PTEN in PTEN replete EC cells enhanced the efficacy of combined NPB-PARPi treatment. Furthermore, combined inhibition of BADS99 phosphorylation and PARP ablated xenograft growth of PTEN-deficient EC cells. Similarly, a combination of NPB and PARPis significantly suppressed the growth of PTEN deficient patient-derived EC organoids. Hence, combined inhibition of BADS99 phosphorylation and PARP represents a rational and efficacious strategy to improve the prognosis of recurrent EC patients.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

distillable ethanol concentrations. We have previously demonstrated a two-stage fermentation process that recycles xylose with xylose isomerase to increase ethanol productivity, where the low sugar concentrations in the hydrolysate limit the final ethanol concentrations. In this study, three approaches are combined to increase ethanol concentrations. First, the medium-additive requirements were investigated to reduce ethanol dilution. Second, methods to increase the sugar concentrations in the sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate were undertaken. Third, the two-stage fermentation process was recharacterized with high gravity hydrolysate. It was determined that phosphate and magnesium sulfate are essential to the ethanol fermentation. Additionally, the Escherichia coli extract and xylose isomerase additions were shown to significantly increase ethanol productivity. Finally, the fermentation on hydrolysate had only slightly lower productivity than the reagent-grade sugar fermentation; however, both fermentations had similar final ethanol concentrations. The present work demonstrates the capability to produce ethanol from high gravity sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate using Saccharomyces pastorianus with low yeast inoculum in minimal medium. Moreover, ethanol productivities were on par with pilot-scale commercial starch-based facilities, even when the yeast biomass production stage was included.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [123, 19, 0], "string": "title={Prognostic value of exercise capacity among patients with treated depression: The Henry Ford Exercise Testing (FIT) Project}, container_title={Clinical Cardiology}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Surfaces, Coatings and Films\", \"Physical and Theoretical Chemistry\", \"Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials\"]", "language": "en", "length": [79, 0, 0], "string": "title={Direct Synthesis of Quantum Dots with Controllable Multimodal Size Distribution}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Horticulture\", \"Plant Science\", \"Agronomy and Crop Science\", \"Genetics\"]", "language": "es", "length": [114, 0, 1868], "string": "title={IMPACTO DE LOS SIDER\u00d3FOROS MICROBIANOS Y FITOSIDER\u00d3FOROS EN LA ASIMILACI\u00d3N DE HIERRO POR LAS PLANTAS: UNA S\u00cdNTESIS}, container_title={}, abstract={El hierro (Fe) es un elemento esencial para pr\u00e1cticamente todos los seres vivos en los que es necesario para importantes funciones celulares como s\u00edntesis de ADN, respiraci\u00f3n y destoxificaci\u00f3n de radicales libres.

segmentation for measuring multi- photon decays of positronium to improve the charge (C), charge-parity (CP), and charge-parity-time reversal (CPT) violations in lepton sector as well as for studying rare decays. In addition, various exotic decays of positronium can be studied with the KAPAE detector. In the KAPAE, all aspects of the detector design, fabrication, and data analysis for physics studies related to positronium annihilation are covered. In this paper, we describe the above-mentioned first fully assembled detection system developed for KAPAE, which consists of a trigger and a gamma-ray detector. The newly proposed multi-layered trigger consists of a 22Na positronium source deposited on a plastic scintillator and a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM), and the gamma-ray detector contains an aerogel at the centre in a nitrogen environment. The gamma-ray detector minimizes pile-up events by fine segmentation of 196 Bi4Ge3O12 (BGO) crystal scintillators, whose scintillation lights from both sides are readout by the SiPM. The signals of a 392-channel SiPM are fed to a preamplifier followed by a 65 MHz flash analog-to-digital converter (FADC). In this paper, the KAPAE detector design, fabrication, and performance are presented.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

expression level of long-non-coding RNA ZFAS1 in breast tissue of healthy women and obesity}, container_title={}, abstract={Background: Epidemiological and experimental literature indicates that the risk of breast cancer incidence is strongly linked to hormone-dependent factors, including reproductive history and obesity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between these factors and breast cancer risk are poorly understood. The aim of this study, therefore, was to determine whether obesity and reproductive history are associated with expression levels of two breast cancer-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), namely ZFAS1 and SRA1 in cancer-free breast tissues of women. Methods: In the current research, 145 healthy women were recruited, and the quantitative expression levels of the two lncRNAs were determined through qPCR assay after gathering the mammoplasty breast tissue samples. Results: It was found that women with body mass index (BMI)\u226530 kg/m2 and BMI 25\u201329 kg/m2 show a low expression of ZFAS1 compared to the BMI2 ( P=0.031 and P=0.027, respectively). Then, the correlation analysis disclosed a negative correlation of ZFAS1 low expression with increasing BMI (r=\u22120.194, P=0.019). Interestingly, this analysis demonstrated a negative correlation between low expression of the ZFAS1 and high BMI in women with menarche age below 14 (r=\u2212221; P=0.028). Lastly, it was also revealed that there was a negative association of the low expression level of ZFAS1 with increasing BMI in women through regression models (B=\u22120.048, P=0.019). Conclusions: These findings suggest interesting clues about the links between high BMI and the expression levels of ZFAS1 in non-diseased breasts that may help us better understand the underlying mechanisms through which obesity contributes to breast carcinogenesis. However, such results need more validations in future research.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Music\"]", "language": "it", "length": [25, 20, 0], "string": "title={A Mercedarian Antiphonary}, container_title={Revue de musicologie}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Pharmaceutical Science\"]", "language": "en", "length": [122, 0, 0], "string": "title={Boosting lung accumulation of gallium with inhalable nano-embedded microparticles for the treatment of bacterial pneumonia}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Behavioral Neuroscience\", \"Physiology\", \"Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [64, 29, 479], "string": "title={The fire burns within: Individual motivations for self-sacrifice}, container_title={Behavioral and Brain Sciences}, abstract={AbstractExtreme self-sacrifice in intergroup conflict may be driven not only by situational factors generating \u201cfusion,\u201d but also by interindividual differences.

At the time, a variety of women wrote and staged plays that grew out of their commitment to the political, ideological and social context of the movement. The 'Mock Parliament,' a form of theatrical parody in which men's and women's roles are reversed, was collectively created by different groups of suffragists in Manitoba, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. This article attempts to recuperate these works for a history of Canadian feminist theatre. It will argue that the 'dual' conservative and liberal ideology of the suffrage movement informs all aspects of the Mock Parliament. On the one hand, these plays critique the division of gender roles that material feminism wants to uphold; they are testimony to the strength of a woman's movement that knew how to work as equal players within traditionally structured political organizations. On the other hand, they betray the safe, moderate tactics of an upper and middle-class, white womanhood who wanted political representation but no structural social change. These opposing tensions are inherent in theatrical parody which is both imitative and critical.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Ecology\", \"Aquatic Science\", \"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [146, 14, 0], "string": "title={Short-term variability in the photosynthetic activity of microphytobenthos as detected by measuring rapid light curves using variable fluorescence}, container_title={Marine Biology}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Electrical and Electronic Engineering\", \"Condensed Matter Physics\", \"Electrical and Electronic Engineering\", \"Condensed Matter Physics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [41, 36, 937], "string": "title={Amalgams as Alternative Bonding Materials}, container_title={Soldering & Surface Mount Technology}, abstract={Amalgams, which are mechanically alloyed mixes of a liquid metal with a powder, offer advantages in situations where large devices are to be bonded to materials with significant coefficient of expansion differences or where extremely temperature\u2010sensitive devices are to be bonded.

pollen extraction and appear in pollen slides. They represent important proxies and indicators of environmental change that can be integrated with pollen studies of landscape history. NPPs have been widely studied in Europe since the 1970s and regularly included in paleoecological studies, whereas in the United States only the most common NPPs have been routinely tallied. The aim of this study is to contribute to the validation of the use of NPPs in the reconstruction of landscape history. We analyzed NPPs in modern and fossil sediment samples from Stonehouse Meadow, located in Spring Valley in the eastern part of central Nevada. We present a total of 64 modern and fossil NPPs, with images and morphological descriptions given for all previously unknown NPPs and a selection of the most important known NPPs. The comparison of pollen and NPPs in the fossil sediments improves our interpretation of the ecological changes of the last 8000 yr.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Animal Science and Zoology\", \"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [165, 0, 1034], "string": "title={Reproductive bionomics of some shallow-water lysianassoids in the Saint Lawrence Estuary, with a review on the fecundity of the Lysianassoidea (Crustacea, Amphipoda)}, container_title={}, abstract={The life history and fecundity of five shallow-water lysianassoids from the Saint Lawrence Estuary were examined. Orchomenella minuta and Or. pinguis are annual and iteroparous (two broods), Psammonyx terranovae is iteroparous (two broods) and probably biennial, and Anonyx sarsi and Onisimus litoralis are biennial and semelparous. Females of A. sarsi and On. litoralis cease feeding on bait shortly before or after oviposition, whereas females of the iteroparous Or. pinguis stop feeding on bait only when broods are in the latest stages of embryo development. These ontogenetic changes may result from gut constriction caused by developing ovaries and broods, or may be due to behavioural changes. Data on the fecundity of the Lysianassoidea are reviewed, and it is concluded that deep-living species are probably much less fecund than shallow-living species.

A perfect human resource management system is conducive to the long-term development of enterprises. Aiming at improving the current situation of enterprise human resource management, a distributed human resource management system is proposed in this paper based on Spark framework. Aiming at the disadvantages of traditional k -means algorithm in processing massive data, such as low computational efficiency and high time complexity, an improved k -means algorithm based on Spark computing framework is proposed. Through the spatial location relationship with the cluster center, redundant calculation is reduced and the ability of processing massive data is improved for the system. Combined with the actual situation of the enterprise, the human resource management system architecture is designed by using Java EE human-computer interaction. The proposed system can achieve user management, employee information, attendance, evaluation, performance, salary, personnel change, and other business management. The experimental results demonstrate that the system can effectively reduce the time complexity of calculation and improve the system efficiency.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

We consider here multichannel data in which one knows only that the noise is less polarized than the signal in a unitary space. This description of the noise is not sufficient for designing filters which are optimum in any sense; consequently, the filters may require a number of changes in the parameters before a satisfactory design can be found. Once this design has been achieved, the filters can be used to enhance waveforms of arbitrary shape, requiring little prior knowledge of the spectral content or temporal features of the signal.

Both trickle irrigation and polyethylene mulch, alone and in various combinations, increased stem growth and early and total yields of watermelon compared to untreated watermelons. Greatest stem growth and early and total yields were obtained from plants grown on polyethylene mulch in combination with trickle irrigation. Mean fruit weight did not vary with treatment.

the Upper Ordovician (Katian) of the Cincinnati Arch Region, U.S.A.: An Assessment of Growth, form, and Water Flow Dynamics}, container_title={}, abstract={Spatiopora Ulrich, 1882 is a trepostome bryozoan that is found encrusting living orthoconic nautiloids in the Upper Ordovician (Katian) of North America, as do several other bryozoans. These epizoozoan bryozoans are characterized by possessing thin unilaminate zoaria with rows of elongate maculae, which may be monticulate and aligned coaxially to the host growth axis. These develop a distinctive linear shape in response to growing on a conical host, rather than as a response to channelized water flow along the host. Monticules increase in size and spacing adorally until a maximum inter-macular area is reached that results in a decline in surface water flow efficiency, and a new monticular line is inserted. Orthocones normally swam forward at lower velocities that enabled lophophore eversion and feeding, which would have been impossible at the higher speeds reached when the host jetted backwards during escape. Monticules reduced drag and turbulence acting on the orthocones which allowed for more efficient venting of bryozoan macular excurrents. Characteristic elliptical monticule growth continued even after death of the motile host.

Previously, we and others have reported that lapatinib, erlotinib (EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors/TKIs) and nilotinb, imatinib (BCR-Abl TKIs) reverse ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated MDR. MRP7/ABCC10, a member of MRP family, shares a structural homology with other ABC transporters such as P-gp/ABCB1. MRP7 is involved in effluxing several anticancer drugs resulting in poor chemotherapeutic outcome. In an effort to reverse MRP7-mediated MDR, we discovered that EGFR TKIs lapatinib, erlotinib, and BCR-Abl TKIs imatinib, nilotinib enhances the sensitivity of MRP7-transfected HEK293 (HEK-MRP7-2) cells to the established MRP7 substrates, such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, vincristine and vinorelbine in concentration-dependent manner. However, there was no significant effect of these TKIs on the sensitivity of control HEK293-pcDNA3.1 cells. In addition, these TKIs increased the intracellular accumulation of [3H]paclitaxel, inhibiting MRP7-mediated [3H]paclitaxel efflux from HEK-MRP7-2 cells. Moreover, Western blot analysis showed no significant change in the MRP7 expression level in the MRP7 overexpressing cell line on treatment with aforementioned TKIs. We conclude that both EGFR TKIs (lapatinib, erlotinib) and BCR-Abl TKIs (imatinib, nilotinib) reverse MRP7-mediated MDR through inhibition of the drug efflux function of MRP7, suggesting that TKI based combinational chemotherapy may be useful in cancer clinical practice.

University students are especially prone to develop IA and risk factors for its development in this population during pandemics are not fully investigated nor understood. This study aimed to identify possible risk factors of IA in the studied population during the ongoing pandemic and to compare it with risk factors in pre-pandemic time. Methods In April 2016 and April 2022 a validated, anonymous questionnaire that contained questions regarding demographic data, as well as Young's Internet Addiction Test, was self-administered to a cross-faculty representative student sample of the University of Osijek, Croatia. Results The study included 1602 university students median age of 21 years (interquartile range 20-22), 34.5% males, and 65.5% females. There was no statistically significant difference in the median age between the two student samples (p = 0.234). The main reason for internet use (social networking and entertainment and online gaming) was considered the significant risk factor for IA in a studied population in pre-pandemic time (the year 2016) and pandemic time (the year 2022) (p &lt; 0.001). In pre-pandemic time the IA was more frequent in males (p = 0.046) while the difference in IA prevalence between sexes did not exist during pandemics (p = 0.160). During pandemics, the students who did not work during their study had higher proportions of IA (p = 0.021) while there was no difference in IA prevalence among students regarding their working status during the study in pre-pandemic time (p = 0.251). Conclusions During the COVID-19 pandemic working status of students has been recognized as the new risk factor for IA in the Croatian university students population. Further studies are needed to identify other possible risk factors for IA in the studied population during pandemics.

poor prognosis in estrogen receptor (ER) negative early-stage breast cancer. Co-treatment with M, a GR antagonist, potentiates effects of chemotherapy in ER- breast cancer xenograft studies. Herein we describe results of a phase 1 dose-escalation study of M plus E, with an ongoing dose expansion cohort in pts with GR+ TNBC. Objectives: Determine 1) safety and tolerability, 2) recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of M + E, and 3) characterize pharmacokinetics (PK) and clinical activity of M in pts with GR+ TNBC. Methods: Eligibility: 1) relapsed/refractory breast, ovarian, prostate, urothelial, sarcoma, or non-small cell lung cancer; 2) 2-5 prior chemotherapy regimens for advanced disease; 3) ECOG PS 0-1; and 4) adequate end-organ function. Study used a 3 + 3 dose escalation scheme. After a 7 day lead-in of M alone, M was administered by mouth daily in combination with E given IV on days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle. Results: 13 pts in Part 1 Dose escalation with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) were treated with M+E: 5 TNBC, 8 GR+ tumors, 2 GR- tumors, and 3 of unknown GR status. Pts were treated at 3 dose levels (DL)[M mg/d, E mg/m2]: 3 at DL1 [600, 1.1] 4 at DL-1a [300, 1.4], and 6 at DL-1 [300, 1.1]. Median duration of treatment was 90+ days. Neutropenia leading to delay of E was dose limiting in 4 pts. CTAE Grade 3/4 neutropenia was observed in 10 pts over all DL, but easily managed (9 pts with growth factor support). Other grade 3+ toxicities were neuropathy (2 pts) and onycholysis (1 pt). No other significant toxicity was noted. RP2D was determined as 300mg/d M and 1.1mg/m2 E. At this DL there were no DLTs. PK of M and E were as predicted from published literature with no evidence of drug-drug interaction (DDI). A total of 6 pts received this dose (3 TNBC; 3 MBC). All 3 TNBC were GR+. 1 had partial response, 1 had stable disease, and 1 had progressive disease. A phase I/II study of M+E is now in progress. To date, 3 GR+ TNBC pts have been treated for a median of 28+ days. Conclusion: M + E is a novel combination designed to improve antitumor activity. It is well tolerated with evidence of clinical activity and no evidence of DDI. RP2D is 300mg M + E 1.1mg/m2. Study is ongoing in expansion phase where recruitment is limited to pts with GR+ TNBC. Additional PK and clinical data will be presented. Citation Format: Wilks S, Modiano M, Spira A, Becerra C, Walling J, Nguyen D, Baker G, Conzen SD, Nanda R.

the cost-effectiveness of this method. The study sample was 409 physicians who were nonrespondents to two previous mailings of a medical specialty society survey. Eligible physicians were designated at random to receive afinal mailing either by U.S. Postal Service certified mail including a return-receipt postcard or by first-class mail. There was a higher response rate from the certified mail group compared with the first-class mail group (41.3% versus 24.8%; relative risk = 1.66, 95% Confidence Interval 1.25, 2.21). A cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the cost per respondent was higher using certified mail versus first-class mail in the third mailing ($2.77 versus $2.34).

The improper use of antibiotics, as well as, the consumption of antibiotics without prescription, will increase the resistance of C. diphtheriae. This study aims to determine the susceptibility pattern and the effectiveness of C. diphtheriae to several antibiotics.METHODS: A total of 57 C. diphtheriae isolates were recultured by using Blood Agar (BA) and Cystine Tellurite Blood Agar (CTBA). Afterward, these isolates were identified by using API Coryne. The antibiotic susceptibility pattern was determined by using Kirby Bauer Method based on CLSI M45-A2.RESULTS: These studies revealed that as the primary choice of diphtheria cases, 10.5% of C. diphtheriae isolates were resistant to Penicillin and 5.3% were resistant to erythromycin. Seven isolates (12%) showed resistance to more than one antibiotics, such as tetracycline and clindamycin, vancomycin and clindamycin, penicillin and tetracycline, also penicillin and vancomycin. Moreover, 4 isolates (7%) were resistant to 3-5 antibiotics. All isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin and linezolid.CONCLUSION: Some C. diphtheriae isolates were resistant to penicillin and erythromycin, which are known as the primary choice for the treatment of C. diphtheriae infection. Even though, all isolates susceptible to moxifloxacin and linezolid.KEYWORDS: Corynebacterium diphtheriae, resistance, antimicrobial}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

TU-BcX-4IC is a clinically aggressive tumor exhibiting rapid growth in vivo, spontaneous metastases, and elevated levels of cell-free DNA and circulating tumor cell DNA. Relative chemosensitivity of primary cells derived from TU-BcX-4IC was performed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) oncology drug set, crystal violet staining, and cytotoxic live/dead immunofluorescence stains in adherent and organoid culture conditions. We employed novel spheroid/organoid incubation methods (Pu\u00b7MA system) to demonstrate that TU-BcX-4IC is resistant to paclitaxel. An innovative physiologically relevant system using human adipose tissue was used to evaluate presence of cancer stem cell-like populations ex vivo. Tissue decellularization, cryogenic-scanning electron microscopy imaging and rheometry revealed consistent matrix architecture and stiffness were consistent despite serial transplantation. Matrix-associated gene pathways were essentially unchanged with serial passages, as determined by qPCR and RNA sequencing, suggesting utility of decellularized PDXs for in vitro screens. We determined type V collagen to be present throughout all serial passage of TU-BcX-4IC tumor, suggesting it is required for tumor maintenance and is a potential viable target for MBC.

Activity Is Superior to NREM Parameters for Predicting Non-sleep Restricted Vigilance}, container_title={Sleep}, abstract={Abstract Introduction Currently unknown is whether REM-like neural activity reverses, incurs, or is neutral with respect to its effect on sleep pressure independent from NREM recovery. We investigated the relationship between a novel scalp-EEG measure of REM-like neural activity and next-day performance on the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) \u2013 a sensitive measure of sleep debt. Our EEG measure reflects the oscillatory-theta activity (OTA) that is the hallmark of REM sleep in animal studies. This method preserves amplitude information, isolates OTA from aperiodic theta-band power, and accounts for REM-like activity thought to occur outside of conventionally scored-REM epochs. We compared the PVT-association of OTA, traditionally measured EEG REM-theta, and traditional sleep parameters. To assess REM-like independent effects, we controlled for traditional parameters using a multivariate model. Methods Our method uses Irregular-Resampling Auto-Spectral Analysis to remove the aperiodic spectrum, followed by low-band power normalization to derive the relative oscillatory-theta activity (OTA). The average OTA was then used to predict next-day performance on the PVT. Traditional sleep parameters (sleep efficiency, total sleep time, %NREM, %N3, and delta-band power) were also examined. We combined data from two previously reported in-laboratory studies resulting in a sample size of 42 healthy young adult subjects. Analyses used non-sleep restricted overnight EEG recordings from a frontal channel. Results There was a substantial PVT-OTA association (OTA positively correlated with response-time and thus with reduced vigilance) during scored-REM epochs (r=0.44, p=0.003). This was stable irrespective of conventional sleep staging when using all sleep epochs (r=0.48, p=0.001), and OTA during scored-NREM (r=0.35, p=0.02). The effect was also stable after controlling for total sleep time, %NREM, and N3 delta-band power in a multivariate model (all-sleep PVT-OTA: r=0.5, p=0.004). Traditional sleep parameters were not significantly correlated with PVT performance. Conclusion OTA was a superior quantitative predictor of reduced next-day vigilance than traditional sleep parameters, and this persisted after controlling for NREM parameters. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that periods of high REM-like activity are less restorative than other periods and may actually increase homeostatic sleep pressure.

larger Language models proposed very often setting new state-of-the-art. These models are exorbitantly effective in learning the representation of words and their internal coherence in a particular language. However, an established context-driven, end to end text generation model is very rare, even more so for the Bengali language. In this paper, we have proposed a Bidirectional gated recurrent unit (GRU) based architecture that simulates the conditional language model or the decoder portion of the sequence to sequence (seq2seq) model and is further conditioned upon the target context vectors. We have explored several ways of combining multiple context words into a fixed dimensional vector representation that is extracted from the same GloVe language model which is used to generate the embedding matrix. We have used beam search optimization to generate the sentence with the maximum cumulative log probability score. In addition, we have proposed a human scoring based evaluation metric and used it to compare the performance of the model with unidirectional LSTM and GRU networks. Empirical results prove that the proposed model performs exceedingly well in producing meaningful outcomes depicting the target context. The experiment leads to an architecture that can be applied to an extensive domain of context-driven text generation based applications and which is also a key contribution to the NLP based literature of the Bengali language.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Psychiatry and Mental Health\"]", "language": "en", "length": [69, 0, 0], "string": "title={Psychosocial Treatment for First-Episode Psychosis: A Research Update}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Toxicology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [56, 22, 0], "string": "title={The Prenatal Inhalation Toxicity of Acrylic Acid in Rats}, container_title={Toxicological Sciences}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Epidemiology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [99, 0, 0], "string": "title={THE RESPIRATORY METABOLISM OF THE MALARIA PARASITE, P.

For example, of the total of 150 pregnancies in women with thalassemia reported in the literature from 1984 to 2004, 74 pregnancies appear clearly to be documented in patients with thalassemia major, while in the other 76, a reportedly late onset of transfusions suggests a milder phenotype of thalassemia intermedia. We examined the records of all thalassemia patients managed at the Toronto General Hospital, Canada (n = 82 patients with thalassemia major; 23 patients with thalassemia intermedia; 7 patients with hemoglobin E thalassemia = 112 patients over 18 years, of whom 54 are female) to determine the incidence and complications of pregnancy in our population. A surprisingly high number (17) and proportion (31%) of all female thalassemia patients over age 18 years have attempted to become pregnant. A total of 14 (82% of those who attempted pregnancy) of patients (9 thalassemia major; 4 thalassemia intermedia; 1 Hemoglobin E thalassemia) successfully conceived 26 times. The maternal age at first attempt to become pregnant was 29.6 \u00b1 4.9 (range 18\u201337) years; average age at delivery was 27.2 \u00b1 4.1 (range 19\u201333) years. Of the 26 conceptions, 20 were carried to term; 19 live births resulted. Six abortions and one fetal death occurred. Deferoxamine was avoided in all patients during pregnancy; control of body iron was followed using hepatic iron concentration. Pre-pregnancy hepatic iron concentration, obtained 2.8 \u00b1 1.8 (range 1\u20137) years prior to conception, was 9.3 \u00b1 7.9 (range 0.9\u201331) mg/gram dry weight; post partum hepatic iron concentration, obtained 3 \u00b1 3.2 (range 0.2\u201310) years following parturition, was 17.4 \u00b1 9.6 (range 1.25\u201332.5) mg/gram dry weight. There were one reported significant worsening in cardiac function during pregnancy; diabetes (present in one woman prior to pregnancy) developed in another woman during pregnancy.

Information on the association between earlobe crease (ELC) and peripheral artery disease is limited. We assessed this association in community-dwelling older adults. Study Design. A total of 294 Atahualpa residents aged \u226560 years were enrolled. ELC were visually identified by two raters. The ankle-brachial index (ABI), used as a surrogate of peripheral artery disease, was categorized using American Heart Association criteria. Using logistic regression and probability models, adjusted for demographics and cardiovascular risk factors, we assessed the relationship between ELC and abnormal ABI determinations, as well as the influence of age on this association. Results. ELC was identified in 141 (48%) individuals, and abnormal ABI determination was carried out in 56 (19%). The association between ELC and abnormal ABI was nonsignificant in logistic regression and probability models with individuals stratified according to their median age. Conclusions. The association between ELC and abnormal ABI determinations is probably attenuated by the high prevalence of both conditions in older persons. ELC might not be useful for identifying candidates for ABI determination.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

of c-FLIP in Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer Antagonizes Therapeutic Response to Androgen Receptor\u2013Targeted Therapy}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Purpose: To characterize the importance of cellular Fas-associated death domain (FADD)\u2013like interleukin 1\u03b2-converting enzyme (FLICE) inhibitory protein (c-FLIP), a key regulator of caspase-8 (FLICE)\u2013promoted apoptosis, in modulating the response of prostate cancer cells to androgen receptor (AR)\u2013targeted therapy. Experimental Design: c-FLIP expression was characterized by immunohistochemical analysis of prostatectomy tissue. The functional importance of c-FLIP to survival and modulating response to bicalutamide was studied by molecular and pharmacologic interventions. Results: c-FLIP expression was increased in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer tissue relative to normal prostate epithelium (P &lt; 0.001). Maximal c-FLIP expression was detected in castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC; P &lt; 0.001). In vitro, silencing of c-FLIP induced spontaneous apoptosis and increased 22Rv1 and LNCaP cell sensitivity to bicalutamide, determined by flow cytometry, PARP cleavage, and caspase activity assays. The histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), droxinostat and SAHA, also downregulated c-FLIP expression, induced caspase-8- and caspase-3/7\u2013mediated apoptosis, and increased apoptosis in bicalutamide-treated cells. Conversely, the elevated expression of c-FLIP detected in the CRPC cell line VCaP underpinned their insensitivity to bicalutamide and SAHA in vitro. However, knockdown of c-FLIP induced spontaneous apoptosis in VCaP cells, indicating its relevance to cell survival and therapeutic resistance. Conclusion: c-FLIP reduces the efficacy of AR-targeted therapy and maintains the viability of prostate cancer cells. A combination of HDACi with androgen deprivation therapy may be effective in early-stage disease, using c-FLIP expression as a predictive biomarker of sensitivity. Direct targeting of c-FLIP, however, may be relevant to enhance the response of existing and novel therapeutics in CRPC.

We investigated the effects of monoethylene glycol (MEG) on the degree of hydrolysis and mechanical properties of four different commercial PA66/glass fiber composites. Using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (py-GC/MS), we identified the byproducts of PA66 composite hydrolysis: carboxylic acid and alkylamine substances.

The placenta has a unique structure and function to guarantee healthy pregnancy, fetal development, and outcome. Thus, the diabetic environment featuring inflammation, metabolic alterations, and hypoxia, is challenging with increased stress for mother and foetus. Delivery-related complications and adverse post-pregnancy outcomes, for example the increased risk for preeclampsia, are related to placental pathology in the different types of DM. Therefore, understanding disturbed placental development during pathologic pregnancy is important. We hypothesize a placental transcriptome signature present in pathologic pregnancy. We aimed to broaden our understanding of placental adaptations to various forms of diabetic pregnancy. Human placenta samples from healthy controls (n = 29), women with gestational DM (GDM, n = 12), DM type 1 (DM1, n = 17), DM type 2 (DM2, n = 3) and GDM, DM1 or DM2 superimposed by preeclampsia (n = 16) were included. We quantified gene expression by Illumina TruSeq stranded total RNA Sequencing and analyzed data by means of principal component analysis (PCA), differential expression and gene set enrichment. The samples were mainly split by fetal sex in the PCA rather than diabetic subgroups.

Data sharing policies vary by country and region, and few studies have examined the trends and factors related to these policies in journals across the Asian region.Methods: The 2020 Scimago Journal and Country Rank was used to download data about 1,143 Asian journals indexed in Web of Science. Excluding 40 journals inaccessible via the Internet or without English-language websites and author guidelines, 1,103 journals were analyzed through descriptive statistical analyses and the chi-square test.Results: Of the 1,103 journals, 325 (29.5%) had data sharing policies, showing a moderate level of policy adoption among Asian journals. The results of the chi-square test suggested that the impact factor and publisher type (whether a publisher was commercial) were significantly associated with the presence of data sharing policies in journals, but subject categories were not identified as a significant factor. Regarding the strength of data sharing policies, most journals provided policies that only encouraged data sharing.Conclusion: Policies only encouraging data sharing are unlikely to lead to actual data sharing; thus, considering varying levels of policy strength and effective ways to induce authors\u2019 compliance with the policies is important.

In the particular cases, the permittivity tensor of a helical medium corresponds to cholesteric liquid crystals, C*-smectics, biaxial chiral nematics and smectics, Q-plates, chiral sculptured thin films, and helical dislocations. Both perturbative and nonperturbative approaches are considered. The explicit expressions for scattering amplitudes, probabilities, and Stokes parameters of photons are found taking into account the form of the photon wave packet. The selection rules are established showing that the helical medium transfers the momentum and the angular momentum to scattered photons.

Abstract:This paper proclaims the great pedagogical value of that letter collectively written by a few boys from the mountains with their teacher, Lorenzo Milani. The article has three sections: the first one, where the Letter is properly contextualized and its authors as well as whose main audience is clarified. It also explains the reasons behind the translation of the title into Spanish, and how it was received in both Italy and Spain. The second section focuses on the main features of the pedagogy of Mr. Milani, emphasizing particularly the difference between instruction/learning and education as personal development. It also deals with the relevance of relations -love- with the world, with the others and with the Other. The article concludes by sintetizing some of the main contributions of the milanian pedagogy and of the \u201eLetter to a Teacher\u201f to the current Spanish educational system.}",

abstract={Abstract We present novel methods for detecting lexical entailment in a fully rule-based and explainable fashion, by automatic construction of semantic graphs, in any language for which a crowd-sourced dictionary with sufficient coverage and a dependency parser of sufficient accuracy are available. We experiment and evaluate on both the Semeval-2020 lexical entailment task (Glava\u0161 et al. (2020). Proceedings of the Fourteenth Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pp. 24\u201335) and the SherLIiC lexical inference dataset of typed predicates (Schmitt and Sch\u00fctze (2019). Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 902\u2013914). Combined with top-performing systems, our method achieves improvements over the previous state-of-the-art on both benchmarks. As a standalone system, it offers a fully interpretable model of lexical entailment that makes detailed error analysis possible, uncovering future directions for improving both the semantic parsing method and the inference process on semantic graphs. We release all components of our system as open source software.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

In this article we show that both anti-CD3-triggering (AICD) and doxorubicin treatment led to the production of a functionally active CD95L in the CD3+/T-cell receptor-positive (TCR+) T leukemia cell line H9. CD95L-expressing H9 cells killed CD95-sensitive J16 or CEM target cells, but not CD95-resistant CEM or J16 cells overexpressing dominant negative FADD (J16/FADD-DN). By immunoprecipitation, CD95L was physically bound to CD95, suggesting that AICD and doxorubicin-induced apoptosis involve CD95L-mediated CD95 aggregation, thereby triggering the CD95 death pathway. CD95 aggregation was associated with the recruitment of FADD and caspase-8 to the CD95 receptor to form the CD95 death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), resulting in caspase-8 activation and cleavage of the effector caspase-3 and PARP. Blocking of the CD95L/receptor interaction by antagonistic antibodies to CD95 or to CD95L also blocked AICD and inhibited the early phase of doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, though cell death induced by doxorubicin eventually proceeded in a CD95-independent manner. These findings may explain some conflicting data on the role of death receptor systems in drug-induced apoptosis. Thus, in cells with an inducible CD95 receptor/ligand system, drug-induced apoptosis may be mediated by CD95L-initiated DISC formation and activation of downstream effector programs similar to AICD in T cells.

Evidence from in vitro studies has shown that high ALDH1 expression identifies tumorigenic cell population which is capable of self-renewal and generating tumors which recapitulate the heterogeneity of the primary tumors. Expression of androgen receptor is present in 70-90% cases of invasive breast cancers at a frequency that is higher than the expression of estrogen or progesterone receptors. However, prognostic relevance of androgen receptor expression in relation to the expression of ALDH1 has not been investigated. Methodology: Immunohistochemical expression of ALDH1 and AR was evaluated in formalin fixed paraffin embedded blocks from 177 invasive breast cancer cases at a single institution in Pakistan from 2006-2010. Clinico-pathological details and follow-up data were collected from patients' medical charts. Data analysis was performed on SPSS version 19. Over-all survival and 5-year disease free survival were estimated by Kaplan Meier. Results: The mean age of the patients was 53.9 (+ 12.40) years. Fifteen percent patients were diagnosed with stage I disease, 52% with stage II, 25% and 8% presented with stage III and stage IV disease, respectively. Twelve percent patients presented with T1 tumors, 49.7% patients presented with T2 tumors whereas 23.7% and 14.6 % patients presented with T3 and T4 tumors respectively. Fifty-seven percent patients were node positive. Estrogen and progesterone receptor expression was present in 62% and 52% of tumors respectively. HER-2/neu was overexpressed /amplified in 30% tumors. Immunohistochemical expression of androgen receptor (AR) was present in 63.8% tumors whereas ALDH1 expression was present in 28.8% tumors. Lack of androgen receptor expression was associated with high expression of ALDH1 ( p= 0.009). Cases were divided into two groups: Group1: ALDH1-/AR+ and Group 2: ALDH1+/ AR-. No significant differences were observed between these groups with respect to age, tumor size, stage of disease, HER-2 neu over-expression/amplification or nodal status. Group 1 phenotype correlated with nuclear grade I and II tumors (p &lt;0.05), estrogen receptor (p &lt;0.05) and progesterone receptor (p &lt;0.05) expression. Group 2 phenotype was associated with nuclear grade III tumors (p &lt;0.05) and estrogen and progesterone receptor negativity (p &lt;0.05). Although not statistically significant, but a trend towards a better over-all survival and 5-year disease free survival was observed in group 1 as compared to group 2. Conclusions: 1. Group 1 phenotype correlated with better prognostic features such as well to moderately differentiated and endocrine responsive tumors. 2. Group 2 phenotype correlated with poor prognostic features such as higher nuclear grade and lack of expression of hormone receptors. 3. Expression of stem cell marker, ALDH1, in group 2 phenotype correlated with poor over-all and 5-year disease free survival.

The intracranial tumours were surgically removed whereas skin and mucosal lesions were biopsied. Histological findings of brain tumours were consistent with a diagnosis of \u201cmelanocytoma\u201d while cutaneous lesions presented \u201cbenign dermal melanocytic infiltrations\u201d. Whole brain irradiation was performed. After 3 months a new melanocytic skin lesion appeared on the scalp with histological picture similar to the other cutaneous ones.

domain of the RNA polymerase \u03b1 subunit (\u03b1CTD) can interact with DNA-sequence elements (known as UP elements) and with activator proteins. We have constructed a series of semi-synthetic promoters carrying both an UP element and a consensus DNA-binding site for the Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein (CRP; a factor that activates transcription by making direct contacts with \u03b1CTD). At these promoters, the UP element was located at a variety of distances upstream of the CRP-binding site, which was fixed at position -41.5 bp upstream of the transcript start. At some positions, the UP element caused enhanced promoter activity whereas, at other positions, it had very little effect. In no case was the CRP-dependence of the promoter relieved. DNase I and hydroxyl-radical footprinting were used to study ternary RNA polymerase-CRP-promoter complexes formed at two of the most active of these promoters, and co-operativity between the binding of CRP and purified \u03b1 subunits was studied. The footprints show that \u03b1CTD binds to the UP element as it is displaced upstream but that this displacement does not prevent \u03b1CTD from being contacted by CRP.

container_title={}, abstract={This systematic review evaluated the knowledge and awareness of peripheral artery disease (PAD) within the general public (including patients with peripheral vascular disease), nonspecialist healthcare professionals (nsHCP), and trainees (medical students and trainee doctors). Relevant articles were identified from electronic databases using key search terms: \u2018peripheral artery disease\u2019; \u2018limb ischaemia\u2019; \u2018intermittent claudication\u2019; \u2018knowledge\u2019; \u2018understanding\u2019; \u2018public\u2019; \u2018medical professional\u2019. The heterogeneous results were described narratively. A lack of knowledge and understanding of PAD (disease awareness) were identified in all groups. Among nsHCPs, factors which affect knowledge include the level of training, early clinical exposure and the presence of family members with cardiovascular/vascular disease. Within the general public, knowledge and awareness was improved if a family member/friend had a diagnosis, or following a patient-centred consultation with any HCP. Public campaigns are proven effective in improving disease knowledge/awareness in conditions such as stroke alongside sustained patient education. These may provide future avenues to improve PAD knowledge and awareness, in order to effectively manage risk factors and minimise delayed or missed diagnosis of PAD.

treatments have, in general, targeted the cancer cell itself. This approach has often been unsuccessful in the long term, especially for solid tumors. Even targeted therapies based on sequencing cancer genomes can be thwarted by genetic heterogeneity within tumors. Furthermore, genomic instability in cancer cells accelerates the generation of variants that are resistant to the treatment. Immunotherapies and anti-angiogenic treatments, which target the tumor-interacting and tumor-adjacent cells, have overcome some of these challenges, suggesting that other methods that target wild-type cells could be valuable in arresting tumor progression. Studies in Drosophila have uncovered mechanisms by which cells within an epithelium can react to neighboring cells that have genetic differences, resulting in the elimination of one population at the expense of another. Some of these mechanisms are now known to be conserved in mammals. The possibility of harnessing such mechanisms to empower normal epithelial cells to eliminate their precancerous neighbors before they develop into fully fledged cancers is an area of research that merits more attention.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Behavioral Neuroscience\", \"Neurology (clinical)\", \"Cognitive Neuroscience\", \"Neurology\", \"Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology\"]", "language": "fr", "length": [100, 0, 0], "string": "title={Prise en charge du syndrome d\u2019apn\u00e9es obstructives du sommeil chez la personne vivant avec un diab\u00e8te}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Sociology and Political Science\", \"Industrial Relations\"]", "language": "fr", "length": [95, 0, 0], "string": "title={Un m\u00e9tier syndical au f\u00e9minin ?

Array Membrane (MTAM)-Based Encapsulated Cell Therapy for Cancer Treatment}, container_title={Membranes}, abstract={The treatment of cancer has evolved significantly in recent years with a strong focus on immunotherapy. Encapsulated Cell Therapy (ECT) for immunotherapy-based anti-cancer treatment is a unique niche within this landscape, where molecules such as signaling factors and antibodies produced from cells are encapsulated within a vehicle, with a host amount of benefits in terms of treatment efficacy and reduced side effects. However, traditional ECTs generally lie in two extremes; either a macro scale vehicle is utilized, resulting in a retrievable system but with limited diffusion and surface area, or a micro scale vehicle is utilized, resulting in a system that has excellent diffusion and surface area but is unretrievable in the event of side effects occurring, which greatly compromises the biosafety of patients. In this study we adapted our patented and novel electrospun Polysulfone (PSF) Microtube Array Membranes (MTAMs) as a \u2018middle\u2019 approach to the above dilemma, which possess excellent diffusion and surface area while being retrievable. Hybridoma cells were encapsulated within the PSF MTAMs, where they produced CEACAM6 antibodies to be used in the suppression of cancer cell line A549, MDA-MB-468 and PC 3 (control). In vitro and in vivo studies revealed excellent cell viability of hybridoma cells with continuous secretion of CEACAM6 antibodies which suppressed the MDA-MB-468 throughout the entire 21 days of experiment. Such outcome suggested that the PSF MTAMs were not only an excellent three-dimensional (3D) cell culture substrate but potentially also an excellent vehicle for the application in ECT systems. Future research needs to include a long term in vivo >6 months study before it can be used in clinical applications.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

regulation of the cell cycle via precise, conserved mechanisms. Critically, the E2F/DP complex controls the expression of essential genes during cell cycle transitions. Here, we discovered the molecular function of the Arabidopsis thaliana SUMO E3 ligase METHYL METHANESULFONATE SENSITIVITY GENE21 (AtMMS21) in regulating the cell cycle via the E2Fa/DPa pathway. DPa was identified as an AtMMS21-interacting protein and AtMMS21 competes with E2Fa for interaction with DPa. Moreover, DPa is a substrate for SUMOylation mediated by AtMMS21, and this SUMOylation enhances the dissociation of the E2Fa/DPa complex. AtMMS21 also affects the subcellular localization of E2Fa/DPa. The E2Fa/DPa target genes are upregulated in the root of mms21-1 and mms21-1 mutants showed increased endoreplication. Overexpression of DPa affected the root development of mms21-1, and overexpression of AtMMS21 completely recovered the abnormal phenotypes of 35S:E2Fa-DPa plants. Our results suggest that AtMMS21 dissociates the E2Fa/DPa complex via competition and SUMOylation in the regulation of plant cell cycle.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0,

But is such asymmetry a prerequisite for cell sorting? We test this using a minimal model in which the two cell populations are identical with respect to their physical properties and differences in motility arise solely from how cells interact with their surroundings. The model resembles the Schelling model used in social sciences to study segregation phenomena at the scale of societies. Our results demonstrate that segregation can emerge solely from cell motility being a dynamic property that changes in response to the local environment of the cell, but that additional mechanisms are necessary to reproduce the envelopment behaviour observedin vitro. The time course of segregation follows a power law, in agreement with the scaling reported from experiment and in other models of motility-driven segregation.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Biochemistry (medical)\", \"Clinical Biochemistry\", \"Endocrinology\", \"Biochemistry\", \"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism\"]", "language": "en", "length": [122, 0, 0], "string": "title={Studies of the Human Testis.

However, most of the related research focused on the influential factors and implementation strategies, with less concern on the evaluation of HiAP. In response to HiAP's call, the Chinese government has proposed health promotion policies (HPPs) in counties or districts, the evaluation of HPPs in sample counties or districts of Sichuan province in China is an essential basis for optimizing policy content, improving policy implementation, and ensuring health promotion's continuous and efficient operation. Methods This paper established an evaluation system for HPPs based on the PMC-Index model and then quantitatively analyzed 37 representative HPPs from the pilot areas in Sichuan province. In addition, a team of experts conducted a field assessment. Results The results showed that the average PMC index of 37 HPPs was 7.091, and correlation analysis showed that there was a significant correlation between the PMC index and expert score. Conclusions This study indicates that the overall consistency of HPPs was good and proves a connection between the formulation and implementation of HPPs.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Food Science\", \"Biotechnology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [121, 0, 0], "string": "title={Drying and extraction of astaxanthin from pink shrimp waste (Farfantepenaeus subtilis): the applicability of spouted beds}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cell Biology\", \"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience\", \"Pharmacology\", \"Molecular Biology\", \"Molecular Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [57, 0, 0], "string": "title={Phosphoglycerate mutase isozymes in the lower vertebrates}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Energy Engineering and Power Technology\", \"Fuel Technology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [144, 0, 0], "string": "title={Recent Literature Mentally-Deficient Children: Their Treatment and Training .

"title={Abstract allocation as a unified approach to polyvariance in control-flow analyses}, container_title={Journal of Functional Programming}, abstract={AbstractIn higher order settings, control-flow analysis aims to model the propagation of both data and control by finitely approximating program behaviors across all possible executions. The polyvariance of an analysis describes the number of distinct abstract representations, or variants, for each syntactic entity (e.g., functions, variables, or intermediate expressions). Monovariance, one of the most basic forms of polyvariance, maintains only a single abstract representation for each variable or expression. Other polyvariant strategies allow a greater number of distinct abstractions and increase analysis complexity with the aim of increasing analysis precision. For example,k-call sensitivity distinguishes flows by the most recentkcall sites,k-object sensitivity by a history of allocation points, and argument sensitivity by a tuple of dynamic argument types. From this perspective, even a concrete operational semantics may be thought of as an unboundedly polyvariant analysis. In this paper, we develop a unified methodology that fully captures this design space. It is easily tunable and guarantees soundness regardless of how tuned. We accomplish this by extending the method of abstracting abstract machines, a systematic approach to abstract interpretation of operational abstract-machine semantics. Our approach permits arbitrary instrumentation of the underlying analysis and arbitrary tuning of an abstract-allocation function. We show that the design space of abstract allocators both unifies and generalizes existing notions of polyvariance. Simple changes to the behavior of this function recapitulate classic styles of analysis and yield novel combinations and variants.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Applied Mathematics\", \"Numerical Analysis\", \"Analysis\"]", "language": "en", "length": [69, 0, 0], "string": "title={Spline solutions to L1 extremal problems in one and several variables}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Mechanical Engineering\", \"Mechanics of Materials\"]", "language": "de", "length": [111, 0, 0], "string": "title={Zur Genauigkeit von Dehnungsme\u00dfstreifen / The accuracy of strain gauges / La precision des jauges de contrainte}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Plant Science\"]", "language": "en", "length": [130, 0, 0], "string": "title={First report of Alternaria alternata causing postharvest black spot rot of jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) in Lu'an, Anhui Province}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"History\"]", "language": "en", "length": [364, 29, 0], "string": "title={Orientalist Aesthetics: Art, Colonialism, and French North Africa, 1880\u20131930.

iron limitation provokes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae exponential cultures. We have demonstrated that one primary response is the induction of bulk autophagy mediated by TORC1. Coherently, Atg13 became dephosphorylated whereas Atg1 appeared phosphorylated. The signal of iron deprivation requires Tor2/Ypk1 activity and the inactivation of Tor1 leading to Atg13 dephosphorylation, thus triggering the autophagy process. Iron replenishment in its turn, reduces autophagy flux through the AMPK Snf1 and the subsequent activity of the iron-responsive transcription factor, Aft1. This signalling converges in Atg13 phosphorylation mediated by Tor1. Iron limitation promotes accumulation of trehalose and the increase in stress resistance leading to a quiescent state in cells. All these effects contribute to the extension of the chronological life, in a manner totally dependent on autophagy activation.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

It overcomes the problems faced with the uncuffed or conventional cuffed tubes used in the pediatric population. In addition, the more distal placement of the polyurethane cuffs in these tubes eliminates the risk of airway mucosal injury and hence postoperative stridor. This makes it an attractive option for neurosurgical patients where there is a high incidence of cranial nerve deficit, airway edema, and the requirement of prolonged postoperative ventilation. But due to this particular design, Murphy's eye is not incorporated in the tube, which can potentially hamper ventilation, especially when used for long duration surgery.

common type of damages that occur in structures subjected to fatigue loading. These breathing cracks induce nonlinearity in the dynamic signatures of the cracked structure which carry useful information about the damage. In this article, we present a new baseline-free algorithm using singular spectrum analysis for breathing crack detection, localization, and characterization. The major advantage of using singular spectrum analysis is that it has the ability to reliably extract the nonlinear harmonics and intermodulation components buried in the noisy components of the response of the structure with breathing crack. A new damage index based on singular spectrum analysis exploiting the nonlinear harmonics and intermodulations in the response is proposed. Numerical simulation studies are carried out to evaluate the proposed damage diagnostic algorithm and later complemented with experimental studies to demonstrate its practical application.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation\", \"Engineering (miscellaneous)\", \"Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality\", \"Human Factors and Ergonomics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [129, 0, 0], "string": "title={Male torque strength in simulated oil rig tasks: the effects of grease-smeared gloves and handle length, diameter and orientation}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Linguistics and Language\", \"Language and Linguistics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [44, 0, 0], "string": "title={CNJ volume 10 issue 1 Cover and Front matter}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Immunology\", \"Immunology and Allergy\", \"Rheumatology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [177, 0, 2924], "string": "title={POS0761 INVESTIGATION ON THE EFFECT AND MECHANISM OF ABNORMALLY ACTIVATED CD8+ T CELLS FROM BONE MARROW ON HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS IN PATIENTS WITH SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS}, container_title={}, abstract={Background:SLE is an autoimmune disease characterized by the abnormal function of lymphocytes. The impairment of hematopoietic function of bone marrow participates in its pathogenesis, in which T cells play an important role. However, study on bone marrow T cells in SLE patients is very limited.Objectives:This study aims to characterize the phenotype and molecular characteristics of abnormally activated CD8+T cells in bone marrow of SLE patients and explore the mechanism of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reduction caused by the abnormally activated CD8+T cells in bone marrow of patients with SLE.Methods:A total of 8 SLE patients and 5 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited in our study. Among them, 3 SLE patients and 4 donors were collected bone marrow and peripheral blood samples for Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and functional studies. BM and peripheral T cell subsets were measured by flow cytometry. Plasma cytokines and secreted immunoglobulins were detected by Luminex. Disease activity of SLE patients was measured using the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). All analyses were performed using R language and Flowjo 9.Results:In the present study, SLE patients had increased CD8+T%\u03b1\u03b2T cells and decreased CD4+T%\u03b1\u03b2T cells in bone marrow of SLE, compared to healthy controls. A large number of CD38+HLADR+CD8+T cells existed in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of SLE patients. Those patients also showed reduced number of HSCs, and with a downward trend of the numbers of peripheral red blood cells, white blood cells, neutrophils, hemoglobin, and platelets. By scRNA-seq, the CD38+HLADR+CD8+T cells contained high levels of GZMK, GZMA, PRF1, IFNG, and TNF in the bone marrow of SLE patients. the CD38+HLADR+CD8+T cells exhibited significant relationship with HSCs, white blood cells, neutrophils, and platelets.Conclusion:These findings demonstrated that the abnormally activated CD8+T cells in bone marrow can reduce the number of HSCs by the expression of killer molecules, which contributes to the impairment of hematopoietic function and the development of SLE. This project focuses on the specific bone marrow T cell subset in SLE. The completement of this project provides information for exploring the mechanism of hematopoiesis involvement.References:[1]Anderson E, Shah B, Davidson A, Furie R.

In 2 years, the BW and BCS of 20% of the ewes in 14 flocks were recorded at the beginning of the mating period (pre-mating), and in the 1st month of lactation (post lambing). BW increased with age (BW = 54\u00b705 \u00d7 (1-e\u22120\u00b7988 \u00d7 age), and the mature weight was not reached until 4 years, after which weight did not differ between pre-mating and post-lambing periods. Body condition score, however, differed between the two periods. The regression coefficients (b) of BW on BCS, when flock-year and age were included in the regressions, differed significantly (P Thirty-seven of these ewes, with BCS between 0\u00b775 and 4\u00b700, were slaughtered, the weights of omental, mesenteric and kidney and channel fat recorded, and the lumbar fat thickness assessed at the last rib. The regressions between the weight of fat deposits and lumbar fat thickness and BW and BCS fitted to semi-logarithmic equations, except for mesenteric fat, in which the relationship was linear. Body condition score was a better predictor than BW for individual fat deposits, with proportionately 0\u00b781 to 0\u00b783 of the variation in the weight of the deposits accounted for by variation in BCS and 0\u00b757 to 070 by variation in BW.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

In the book, Akoto-Abutiate grafts together the African Ghanaian folk proverbs and the proverbial sayings in Proverbs 25:1-29:27 in order to appropriate the Biblical message in the Ghanaian context. For Akoto-Abutiate the Biblical book of Proverbs or the Bible in general is a \u2018tree of life\u2019 and so is/are the African cultural context(s). She, therefore, suggests the \u2018hermeneutic of grafting\u2019 as the most appropriate model through which engagement between African cultural context(s) and the Biblical text can productively happen without undermining the former. The African cultural context in this model is regarded as the dominant and pre-existing tree of life onto which the Biblical shoot(s) are grafted.

selection of agents based on patient profile, target organism, toxicity, costs and the likelihood of emergence and spread of resistance. Methods We report on an observational prospective 12 month study conducted by an antifungal stewardship team targeting the use of echinocandins (caspofungin and micafungin), voriconazole and liposomal amphotericin B in a tertiary referral hospital in the UK. Results One-hundred-and-seventy-three patients were reviewed on 294 occasions. Clinical advice was given and implemented during review of 45 (88.2%) of micafungin prescriptions, 70 (78.7%) of those receiving voriconazole, 78 (62.4%) of those receiving liposomal amphotericin B and 3 (27.3%) of those receiving caspofungin. Except for voriconazole, nearly half of all treatments reviewed were stopped or changed. This study found that a crude cost saving of \u223c\u00a3180 000 in antifungal drugs was generated compared with the previous year. Conclusions Using a multidisciplinary team, antifungal stewardship can achieve significant improvements in patient management and it may reduce costs.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Given the multitude of complex challenges, from often short-term crisis management to long-term health promotion, a better integration of science and practice in the PHS is essential. In Germany, there is a lack of systematically established cooperations and integrated training concepts. However, both are essential to ensure continuous knowledge transfer between science and practice. In the Evidenz\u00d6GD study, representatives from practice, teaching and science jointly develop and pilot new qualification models to qualify public health professionals for work at the interface of practice and science. Based on a systematic analysis of existing collaborations and qualification models, 23 expert interviews were conducted to identify qualification approaches that will enable future public health professionals to work at the interface between science and practice. In a stakeholder workshop planned for July 2022, a multistage decision-making process based on strategic orientation mapping will be conducted to prioritize the identified approaches and generate ideas for new qualification models. In total 17 papers were analyzed and inductively coded according to three main categories. In addition to (1) context-related aspects, such as credentialing, recruitment strategies and resources, also (2) content-related aspects, such as training forms and didactical concepts were extracted. Furthermore, criteria relevant for the further development and continuation of the models (3) could be identified. By strengthening the scientific nature of practice in PHS and anchoring PHS-relevant topics in academia, the Evidenz\u00d6GD project contributes to a sustainable strengthening of evidence-informed approaches in PHS practice. The evidence-informed, participatory development of a tailored qualification model is intended to promote the pilot of the model, which is due in 2023. Key messages \u2022 Integrated qualification models support the strengthening of evidence-based approaches in the public health service (\u00d6GD) and promote the integration of \u00d6GD-relevant issues in science. \u2022 Participatory approaches with explicit consideration of the perspective of young health professionals ensures that new qualification approaches meet the needs and requirements of future generations.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Our study contributes to upper echelons theory and temporal research on strategy, being the first to examine the strategic consequences of top management team time horizon composition.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health\"]", "language": "en", "length": [18, 0, 0], "string": "title={Index of Suspicion}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Psychiatry and Mental Health\", \"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health\", \"Health (social science)\"]", "language": "en", "length": [66, 31, 0], "string": "title={A Systematic Review of Parent and Caregiver Mental Health Literacy}, container_title={Community Mental Health Journal}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Computer Science Applications\", \"History\", \"Education\"]", "language": "en", "length": [73, 37, 649], "string": "title={Failure and protection of metal equipment in Pumped Storage Power Station}, container_title={Journal of Physics: Conference Series}, abstract={Abstract In order to ensure the safe and stable operation of pumped storage hydropower station equipment, it is very important to carry out regular maintenance of metal equipment.

The results showed that planetary ball mill and dynamic high-pressure microfluidization could reduce the particle size of bone powder, and the particle size of sample treated by dynamic high-pressure microfluidization reached 446 nm. Chicken bone particles were negatively charged, and the absolute value of zeta potential was significantly reduced after milling treatments. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis indicated that the planetary ball mill and dynamic high-pressure microfluidization processes presented no significant effect on the internal chemical structure of bone particles. Compared with the other groups, samples treated by dynamic high-pressure microfluidization released more calcium ions, which was related to the significant effects on surface calcium composition and reducing particle size. Therefore, dynamic high-pressure microfluidization has a great potential in the processing of bone-derived products, particularly for the design and development of bone-derived product with high calcium bioaccessibility.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Human-Computer Interaction\", \"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)\"]", "language": "en", "length": [112, 0, 0], "string": "title={Search product and experience product online reviews: An eye-tracking study on consumers' review search behavior}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Literature and Literary Theory\", \"Cultural Studies\"]", "language": "en", "length": [73, 0, 0], "string": "title={Arbitrary, Natural, Other: J.

The concomitant use of two microwires within one microcatheter, also known as the buddy-wire technique, may be helpful for navigation and support in challenging situations. Methods We analyzed all flow diverter procedures in our prospectively collected database. We recorded all patient-related, anatomical and procedural information. We performed univariate statistics and technical descriptions. Results In total, 208 consecutive patients treated with a FD at our institution between July 2014 and August 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. In 17 patients the buddy-wire technique was used (mean age 63 years, range 31\u201387 years: 16 female). Aneurysms were located at the petrous, cavernous, supraophthalmic internal carotid artery, and a proximal M2 branch in 2, 7, 7 and 1 patient(s), respectively. In all cases a 0.027in. microcatheter was used for device deployment. In 14 patients with a wide-necked aneurysm the buddy-wire provided additional support to advance the microcatheter and mitigated the ledge between the aneurysm neck and the parent artery or a side branch. In two giant cavernous aneurysms treated with telescoping FDs, the buddy-wire was used to re-enter the proximal end of the foreshortened FD. Conclusion The buddy-wire is a useful technique in FD procedures to prevent herniation of the microcatheter into the aneurysm sack, in wide-necked aneurysms to mitigate the ledge effect between the aneurysm neck and the parent artery where the microcatheter tip may get stuck, or to enable re-entry into a foreshortened FD.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Methods An opportunity sample of 119 participants (65 female) completed an attitude questionnaire. Results Most participants were in favour of donation though substantially fewer had signed up to the organ donation register. A minority of participants was aware of the proposed opt-out system for donation. Conclusions The results from this study corroborate and extend previous work in that more participants were prepared to receive an organ than donate one. Knowing someone who had donated an organ was associated with a more positive attitude towards donation.

memiliki kandungan nutrisi lengkap, sehingga Spirulina sp. memiliki potensi yang besar untuk dimanfaatkan sebagai bahan pangan fungsional. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui kepadatan atau kelimpahan, berat basah dan berat kering dari Spirulina sp. dalam media pupuk hasil campuran pupuk urea, pupuk zwavelzure amoniak (ZA), dan pupuk triple super phosphate (TSP) dengan membandingkan pada pupuk kontrol dengan standar pada media conwy sebagai langkah alternatif dalam meminimalkan biaya kulturisasi Spirulina sp. sebagai bahan pangan fungsional dalam skala laboratoris. Berdasarkan hasil penelitian, kepadatan spirulina sp. mengalami fase lambat (lagfase) dengan kenaikkan populasi rata-rata 781,5 unit/ml pada hari pertama sampai hari ketiga. Fase percepatan (eksponensial fase) dengan kenaikkan populasi rata-rata 3576,5 unit/ml pada hari keempat sampai hari kelima. Fase perlambatan dengan kenaikkan populasi rata-rata 595,25 unit/ml pada hari keenam sampai hari ketujuh. Dan fluktuatif pada hari kedelapan sampai hari kesembilan, sedangkan berat basah dan berat kering dari Spirulina sp. di hari ketiga sampai dengan hari kelima mengalami peningkatan yang signifikan, sedangkan berat basah dan berat kering di hari-hari berikutnya mengalami fluktuatif peningkatan dan penurunan.Adanya penurunan pertumbuhan dan biomassa dapat disebabkan oleh beberapa faktor, diantarannya, berkurangnya nutrien dalam media, berkurangnya intensitas cahaya karena penanguan sendiri, kompetisi yang semakin besar dalam mendapatkan nutrient, ruang hidup dan cahaya.Makanan fungsional yang mengandung protein tinggi salah satunnya adalah yang terbuat dari microalgae Spirulina sp. microalgae ini tidak hanya bertindak sebagai sumber protein tunggal, tetapi juga sumber karotenoid, klorofil, serta sumber mikronutrien.AbstractSpirulina sp. is a microalgae microorganism that has complete nutritional contents, Spirulina sp. has a great potential to be used as a functional food ingredient. This study aimed to determine the density or abundance, wet and dry weight of Spirulina sp. in fertilizer ingredients resulting from a mixture of urea fertilizer, zwavelzure ammonia (ZA) fertilizer, and triple superphosphate fertilizer (TSP) by comparing the control fertilizers with standards on conwey media an alternative step in minimizing the cost of culturing Spirulina sp. as a functional food ingredient in a laboratory scale. Based on the results of the study, the density of Spirulina sp. experienced a lag phase with an average population increase of 781.5 units/ml on the first day until the third day. Acceleration phase (exponential phase) with an average population increased of 3576.5 units/ml on the fourth day until the fifth day. The deceleration phase with an average population increased of 595.25 units/ml on the sixth day until the seventh day. And fluctuating on the eighth day to the ninth day, while the wet weight and dry weight of Spirulina sp. on the third day until the fifth day experienced a significant increase, while the wet weight and dry weight in the following days experienced a fluctuating increase and decrease. The decrease in growth and biomass could be caused by several factors, i.e., reduction of nutrient ingredients, reduced light intensity due to self-drying, greater competition in obtaining nutrients, living space and light. Functional foods that contained high protein one of them are those made from microalgae Spirulina sp.

of Chemoresistance and Immune Resistance of B-NHL Cell Lines by Overexpression of YY1 and Bcl-xL, Respectively: Reversal of Resistance by Rituximab.}, container_title={Blood}, abstract={Abstract We have recently reported that treatment of B-NHL cell lines with rituximab sensitizes the tumor cells to both chemotherapy and Fas-induced apoptosis (Jazirehi and Bonavida, 2005, Oncogene, 24:2121\u20132145). This study investigated the underlying molecular mechanism of rituximab-mediated reversal of resistance. Treatment of B-NHL cell lines inhibited the constitutively activated NF- \u03baB. Cells expressing dominant active I\u03baB or treated with NF-\u03baB specific inhibitors were sensitized to both drugs and FasL agonist mAb (CH-11)-induced apoptosis. Downregulation of Bcl-xL expression via inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity correlated with chemosensitivity. The direct role of Bcl-xL in chemoresistance was demonstrated by the use of Bcl-xL overexpressing Ramos cells, Ramos HA-BclxL (gift from Genhong Cheng, UCLA), which were not sensitized by rituximab to drug-induced apoptosis. However, inhibition of Bcl-xL in Ramos HA-Bcl-x resulted in sensitization to drug-induced apoptosis. The role of Bcl-xL expression in the regulation of Fas resistance was not apparent as Ramos HA-Bcl cells were as sensitive as the wild type cells to CH-11-induced apoptosis. Several lines of evidence support the direct role of the transcription repressor Yin-Yang 1 (YY1) in the regulation of resistance to CH-11-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of YY1 activity by either rituximab, the NO donor DETANONOate, or following transfection with YY1 siRNA all resulted in upregulation of Fas expression and sensitization to CH-11-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest two complementary mechanisms underlying the chemo-sensitization and immuno-sensitization of B NHL cells by rituximab via inhibition of NF-\u03baB. The regulation of chemoresistance by NF-\u03baB is mediated via Bcl-xL expression whereas the regulation of Fas resistance by NF-\u03baB is mediated via YY1 expression and activity. These findings suggest that drug-resistant NHL tumor cells may be sensitive to immune-mediated therapeutics.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Between 1984 and 2021, we performed choledochal cyst (CC) excision in 256 children at our center. Out of this group, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 59 patients who were operated on under one year of age. Follow-up ranged from 0.3 to 18 years (median 3.9 years). The preoperative course was asymptomatic in 22 (38%), while 37 patients (62%) had symptoms before surgery. The late postoperative course was uneventful in 45 patients (76%). In symptomatic patients, 16% had late complications, while in asymptomatic patients, only 4%. Late complications were observed in the laparotomy group in seven patients (17%). We did not observe late complications in the laparoscopy group.

This precision is accomplished by a localization-dependent translational control mechanism that ensures translation of only correctly localized oskar transcripts. Although progress has been made in identifying localization factors and translational repressors of oskar, none of the known components of the oskar complex is required for both processes. Here, we report the identification of Cup as a novel component of the oskar RNP complex. cup is required for oskar mRNA localization and is necessary to recruit the plus end\u2013directed microtubule transport factor Barentsz to the complex. Surprisingly, Cup is also required to repress the translation of oskar. Furthermore, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is localized within the oocyte in a cup-dependent manner and binds directly to Cup in vitro. Thus, Cup is a translational repressor of oskar that is required to assemble the oskar mRNA localization machinery.

different functional subsets, including regulatory cell subsets expressing the Foxp3. Whether they are correlated with immune-checkpoint mediated T cell immune dysfunction remains unknown in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).MethodsIn this study, we used RNA-seq data from 167 patients in TCGA dataset to analyze the correlation between PD-1 and FOXP3 genes and these two genes\u2019 association with the prognosis of AML patients. The expression proportion of Foxp3+/PD-1+ cells in \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and two subgroups V\u03b41 and V\u03b42 T cells were performed by flow cytometry. The expression level of FOXP3 and PD-1 genes in \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were sorted from peripheral blood by MACS magnetic cell sorting technique were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR.ResultsWe found that PD-1 gene was positively correlated with FOXP3 gene and highly co-expressed PD-1 and FOXP3 genes were associated with poor overall survival (OS) from TCGA database. Then, we detected a skewed distribution of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with increased V\u03b41 and decreased V\u03b42 T cell subsets in AML. Moreover, significantly higher percentages of PD-1+ \u03b3\u03b4, Foxp3+ \u03b3\u03b4, and PD-1+Foxp3+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were detected in de novo AML patients compared with healthy individuals. More importantly, AML patients containing higher PD-1+Foxp3+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells had lower OS, which might be a potential therapeutic target for leukemia immunotherapy.ConclusionA significant increase in the PD-1+Foxp3+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subset in AML was associated with poor clinical outcome, which provides predictive value for the study of AML patients.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Materials Chemistry\", \"Condensed Matter Physics\", \"Ceramics and Composites\"]", "language": "en", "length": [97, 39, 0], "string": "title={Changes of YAP-Phase Content and Some Properties by the Annealing of Si3N4-Al2O3-Y2O3-AlN Ceramic}, container_title={Journal of the Ceramic Society of Japan}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Archeology\", \"Archeology\", \"Conservation\", \"Computer Science Applications\", \"Materials Science (miscellaneous)\", \"Chemistry (miscellaneous)\", \"Spectroscopy\"]", "language": "en", "length": [81, 0, 1664], "string": "title={FTIR study on the phase transition of experimental and archaeological burnt ivory}, container_title={}, abstract={AbstractRecent excavation of the elephant ivories at the Sanxingdui site of the Shang Dynasty in Sichuan, China brings attention to the burnt features of the ivories. However, burnt ivories cannot be assessed by the same criteria established for burnt bones because of the differences in the ways that the two materials respond to heat. This study examines differences in the phase transition characteristics of ivory and bone, and confirms that the threshold temperature of the alteration in ivories is lower than that in bones. In our analysis, elephant ivories and bovine bones burnt at the temperatures between 200 and 1000 \u00b0C in oxidizing or reducing atmosphere are prepared and comparatively investigated by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results show that the transformation from magnesium-substituted hydroxyapatite (Mg-HAp) to magnesium-substituted \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate in ivory dentin takes place at the temperature as low as 800 \u00b0C, while \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate is not observed in bovine bones burnt at 1000 \u00b0C or below mainly because of the different magnesium contents. Due to the destruction of Mg-HAp at 800 \u00b0C in ivories, cyanamidapatite that could form in bones burnt under reducing atmosphere is absent in burnt ivories. With reference to the experimental burnt ivories, archaeological burnt ivories from the Sanxingdui site can now be clearly determined to be burnt unevenly at temperatures up to around 800 \u00b0C. This study may provide further information for archaeological research on ivories from the Sanxingdui site and identification of burnt bioapatite materials in other archaeological findings.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Condensed Matter Physics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [90, 0, 0], "string": "title={Detuning effect in quantum dynamics of a strongly coupled single quantum dot\u2013cavity system}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}]}
