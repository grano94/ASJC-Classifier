of Information Technology & Decision Making}, abstract={Degree centrality is considered to be one of the most basic measures of social network analysis, which has been used extensively in diverse research domains for measuring network positions of actors in respect of the connections with their immediate neighbors. In network analysis, it emphasizes the number of connections that an actor has with others. However, it does not accommodate the value of the duration of relations with other actors in a network; and, therefore, this traditional degree centrality approach regards only the presence or absence of links. Here, we introduce a time-variant approach to the degree centrality measure \u2014 time scale degree centrality (TSDC), which considers both presence and duration of links among actors within a network. We illustrate the difference between traditional and TSDC measure by applying these two approaches to explore the impact of degree attributes of a patient-physician network evolving during patient hospitalization periods on the hospital length of stay (LOS) both at a macro- and a micro-level. At a macro-level, both the traditional and time-scale approaches to degree centrality can explain the relationship between the degree attribute of the patient-physician network and LOS. However, at a micro-level or small cluster level, TSDC provides better explanation while the traditional degree centrality approach is found to be inadequate in explaining its relationship with LOS. Our proposed TSDC measure can explore time-variant relations that evolve among actors in a given social network.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

The realization of scaled tests is extremely important for the validation of a project on real scale, since, through the laws of similitude, such tests make it possible to predict the behavior of structures in the ocean as well as their performance during operation. This research aims to develop, test, and validate an active control algorithm for wave absorption in a two-dimensional wave channel\u2014that is, when the waves propagate in only one direction\u2014based on artificial neural networks (ANN). The ANN control algorithm relies on the linear wave theory and the principle of time-reversal of wave propagation; i.e., the phenomenon of wave absorption corresponds to the wave generation when observed in the reverse direction of time. Through this principle, data from wave generation experiments, after proper manipulation, are used to train an ANN capable of generating the control signal used to move the wave-generator device, this time as a wave absorber}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Sociology and Political Science\", \"Communication\"]", "language": "en", "length": [84, 0, 1054], "string": "title={Digital self-tracking, habits and the myth of discontinuance: It doesn\u2019t just \u2018stop\u2019}, container_title={}, abstract={Digital self-tracking devices increasingly inhabit everyday landscapes, yet many people abandon self-trackers not long after acquisition.

We consider the potential for digital data \u2013 and their unanticipated affects \u2013 to linger within habitual practices even after the device is abandoned. We draw on the philosophies of Felix Ravaisson and Gilles Deleuze to understand habit as a capacity for change, rather than a performance of sameness. We trace how self-tracking prompts new embodiments that continue to unfold even after people disengage. In decentring the device as our object of attention, we trouble the logic that self-tracking simply \u2018stops\u2019 in its absence.

Only a quarter deal with problems themselves. The top priority was easy and quick access to services. The most popular topics for GP training were interactions between teenagers and their parents, child abuse and eating disorders. No GP had formal training in child and adolescent psychiatry and further training was a low priority.Clinical ImplicationsSuch a survey has helped to develop a closer partnership between GPs and their local CAMHS using a service\u2013response model.

container_title={}, abstract={The clinical and pathologic features of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) reflect an abnormal immune response that is thought to be due to the elaboration of a variety of cytokines by the malignant Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells or surrounding tissues. The majority of cHL cases are characterized by expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family members and their ligands, as well as an unbalanced production of Th2 cytokines and chemokines. Activation of TNFR members results in constitutive activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), a transcription factor important for the in vitro and in vivo growth of RS cell lines. The expression of Th2 cytokines and chemokines leads to the reactive infiltrate of eosinophils, Th2 cells, and fibroblasts characteristic of cHL, and can also contribute to a local suppression of Th1 cell\u2013mediated cellular immune response. Another particularly important growth and survival factor for RS cell lines is the Th2 cytokine interleukin 13, which is also commonly expressed by primary RS cells. In approximately 40% of cHL cases, the presence of Epstein-Barr virus influences the Th1/Th2 balance toward the production of Th1 cytokines and chemokines, but this shift is apparently insufficient for the stimulation of an effective antitumor cell-mediated immune response. This review summarizes the current literature on cytokine expression by and activity on RS cell lines and primary cHL tissues, examines cytokine signaling pathways in RS cells, and discusses the role that cytokines play in the specific clinical and pathologic features of cHL.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Electrical and Electronic Engineering\", \"Condensed Matter Physics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [67, 0, 0], "string": "title={On the residual ionospheric error in radio occultation measurements}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Environmental Chemistry\"]", "language": "en", "length": [59, 34, 0], "string": "title={Nitrous oxide emissions from fossil fuel fired power plants}, container_title={Environmental Science & Technology}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Organic Chemistry\", \"Catalysis\"]", "language": "en", "length": [42, 0, 854], "string": "title={OXYMERCURATION OF \u03945-[2,2,2]-BICYCLO\u00d6CTENE}, container_title={}, abstract={It has now been shown that an earlier assignment of configuration in which 1,4-\u2191\u2191-ethylene-\u03945-cyclohexenedicarboxylic acids and their derivatives were presumed to form with mercuric salts 5-\u2193-hydroxy-6-\u2193-anionomercuri-1,4-\u2191\u2191-ethylenecyclohexanedicarboxylic acid derivatives is incorrect.

burden documented after childbirth in women and babies living in sub-Saharan Africa. To date, there is limited information on the quality of postnatal care and/or whether evidence-based interventions to improve postnatal care in a way that meets the specific health needs of each mother and her baby have been lacking. There is also limited data related to how quality of care (respectful or disrespectful) influences women's decision to access postnatal care. Objective To systematically review available qualitative evidence for how quality of care (respectful or disrespectful) influences perceptions and experiences of, and decisions to, access postnatal care for women living in sub-Saharan Africa. Search strategy CINAHL plus, Cochrane library, Global Health, Medline, PubMed, Web of Science were searched from 2009\u20142019. Grey literature was searched on Google Scholar. Selection criteria Qualitative literature in English describing women\u2019s perceptions and experiences of the quality of care they received after childbirth and how this influenced their perceptions of and decisions to access postnatal care. Data analysis Thematic analysis was performed to extract subthemes and themes. Outcomes were themes from the qualitative data used to form a thematic synthesis. Results Fifteen studies were included with data from 985 women interviewed face-to-face across eight countries. Descriptions of respectful care included healthcare providers being kind, supportive and attentive to women\u2019s needs. Women described preferring healthcare services where the healthcare providers communicated in a respectful and caring manner. Descriptions of disrespectful care included verbal and/or physical abuse and power imbalances between women and healthcare providers. Some women were denied postnatal care when attending a healthcare facility after giving birth at home. There is evidence to suggest that vulnerable women (adolescents; women with poor socioeconomic status; women who are HIV positive) are more likely to receive disrespectful care. Conclusions This systematic review describes how aspects of respectful and disrespectful maternity care influence women\u2019s perceptions and experiences of, and decisions to access postnatal care services. There is a need for a renewed focus to prioritise respectful maternity care and to sustainably provide good quality postnatal care to all women and their babies in a way that meets their expectations and health needs.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Cancer}, container_title={}, abstract={Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Immunotherapies (IT) have been rapidly approved for lung cancer treatment after the spectacular results in melanoma. Responses to the currently used checkpoint inhibitors are strikingly good especially in metastatic diseases. However, durable responses are observed in only 25% of cases. Consequently, there is an urgent need for new immunotherapy targets. Among the multiple checkpoints involved in the tumor immune escape, the BTLA-HVEM couple appears to be a promising target. BTLA (B- and T- Lymphocyte Attenuator) is a co-inhibitory receptor mainly expressed by B and T cells, repressing the activation signal transduction. BTLA shares similarities with other immune checkpoints such as PD-1 and CTLA-4 which are the targets of the currently used immunotherapies. Furthermore, BTLA expression points out terminally exhausted and dysfunctional lymphocytes, and correlates with lung cancer progression. The ligand of BTLA is HVEM (Herpes Virus Entry Mediator) which belongs to the TNF receptor family. Often described as a molecular switch, HVEM is constitutively expressed by many cells, including cells from tumor and healthy tissues. In addition, HVEM seems to be involved in tumor immuno-evasion, especially in lung tumors lacking PD-L1 expression. Here, we propose to review the role of BTLA-HVEM in immuno-escape in order to highlight its potential for designing new immunotherapies.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering\", \"Mechanical Engineering\"]", "language": "en", "length": [122, 0, 0], "string": "title={A compression-torsion-wear-test achieving contact pressures of up to eight times the initial flow stress of soft aluminium}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Education\"]", "language": "en", "length": [74, 0, 624], "string": "title={\"Happy Consciousness\": Ideology and Hidden Curricula In Literacy Education}, container_title={}, abstract={The content of five widely-used ABE reading series was analyzed 13 years ago by Gerald Coles (1977).

Communications barriers, however, are fading away, because at each level, educational, corporate divisional, and in operations, geologists are becoming better geophysicists and geophysicists are becoming better geologists. Their formerly discrete endeavors are becoming better coordinated and their work less separate. Geophysicists have been largely concerned with measurements of earth\u2010crust phenomena. Incorporation of more geology into such measurements has increased the reliability of the conclusions. As knowledge of the earth increases, the application of geology becomes less of an intuitive matter and thus more precise also. In this epoch in which oil and gas exploration proceeds to progressively greater depths, the distinction between a petroleum geologist and a petroleum geophysicist becomes more difficult to define. The time appears to be approaching when universities aiming graduates at the petroleum industry may graduate petroleum earth scientists, not geologists and geophysicists.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Management of Technology and Innovation\"]", "language": "en", "length": [42, 23, 0], "string": "title={Emergency Maternal and Infant Care Program}, container_title={Public Health Economics}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Nutrition and Dietetics\", \"Food Science\"]", "language": "en", "length": [118, 0, 0], "string": "title={Resting Energy Expenditure and Nutritional Status in Children with Sickle Cell Disease after Glutamine Supplementation}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Immunology\", \"Immunology and Allergy\", \"Rheumatology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [148, 27, 1563], "string": "title={Tumor Necrosis Factor-\u03b1 \u2212308 Genotypes Influence Inflammatory Activity and TNF-\u03b1 Serum Concentrations in Children with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis}, container_title={The Journal of Rheumatology}, abstract={Objective.Considering the relevance of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in the pathophysiology of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), it is likely that polymorphisms in its promoter area may be relevant in disease susceptibility and activity. We investigated if clinical measures of JIA activity and TNF-\u03b1 serum concentrations were associated with TNF-\u03b1 \u2212308 genotypes.Methods.Portuguese patients with JIA in 5 pediatric rheumatology centers were recruited consecutively, along with a control group of healthy subjects. Demographic and clinical data and blood samples were collected from each patient. DNA was extracted for analysis of TNF-\u03b1 gene promoter polymorphisms at position \u2212308 by restriction fragment-length polymorphism.Results.One hundred fourteen patients and 117 controls were evaluated; 57% of patients presented the oligoarticular subtype, 25% the polyarticular subtype, 8% the systemic subtype, and 9% had enthesitis-related arthritis and 5% psoriatic arthritis. Twenty-four percent of the patients presented the \u2212308 GA/AA genotypes and 76% the \u2212308 GG genotype, similar to findings in controls. Patients with the \u2212308 GA/AA genotype had higher degree of functional impairment, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 100-mm visual analog scale score for disease activity, and TNF-\u03b1 levels compared to those with the \u2212308 GG genotype.Conclusion.TNF-\u03b1 \u2212308 GA/AA genotypes were found to be related to higher inflammatory activity and worse measures of disease activity in Portuguese patients with JIA.

Comparative analyses of plasmid pAC3 and other Aeromonas sp. IncU-type plasmids revealed a mobile insertion cassette element with a unique structure containing a qnrS2 gene and a typical miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) structure. This study also revealed that this MITE sequence appears in other Aeromonas species plasmids and chromosomes.

Preventative lifestyle behaviors, such as regular exercise, play a critical role in attenuating chronic disease burden. However, the exact mechanism behind exercise as a form of preventative medicine remains poorly defined. Interestingly, many of the physiological responses to exercise are comparable to aging. This paper explores an overarching hypothesis that exercise protects against aging/age-related chronic disease because the physiological stress of exercise mimics aging. Acute exercise transiently disrupts cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and brain function and triggers a substantial inflammatory response in a manner that mimics aging/age-related chronic disease. Data indicate that select acute exercise responses may be similar in magnitude to changes seen with +10\u201350 years of aging. The initial insult of the age-mimicking effects of exercise induces beneficial adaptations that serve to attenuate disruption to successive \u201caging\u201d stimuli (i.e., exercise). Ultimately, these exercise-induced adaptations reduce the subsequent physiological stress incurred from aging and protect against age-related chronic disease. To further examine this hypothesis, future work should more intricately describe the physiological signature of different types/intensities of acute exercise in order to better predict the subsequent adaptation and chronic disease prevention with exercise training in healthy and at-risk populations.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Sociology and Political Science\", \"Development\", \"Education\"]", "language": "en", "length": [9, 0, 0], "string": "title={Editorial}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Mechanical Engineering\", \"Mechanics of Materials\", \"Condensed Matter Physics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [59, 0, 1340], "string": "title={The shape, stability and breakage of pendant liquid bridges}, container_title={}, abstract={Pendant liquid bridges are defined as pendant drops supporting a solid axisymmetric endplate at their lower end. The stability and shape properties of such bridges are defined in terms of the capillary properties of the system and of the mass and radius of the lower free-floating endplate. The forces acting in the pendant liquid bridge are defined exactly and expressed in dimensionless form. Numerical analysis has been used to derive the properties of a given bridge and it is shown that as the bridge grows by adding more liquid to the system a maximum volume is reached. At this maximum volume, the pendant bridge becomes unstable with the length of the bridge increasing spontaneously and irreversibly at constant volume. Finally the bridge breaks with the formation of a satellite drop or an extended thread. The bifurcation and breakage processes have been recorded using a high-speed video camera with a digital recording rate of up to 6000 frames per second. The details of the shape of the bridge bifurcation and breakage for many pendant bridge systems have been recorded and it is shown that satellite drop formation after rupture is not always viscosity dependent.

Trata-se de um estudo transversal realizado em 20.113 escolares (9.992 meninas) em 83 escolas com idades de 3 a 17 anos. O estado nutricional foi determinado pelo \u00edndice de massa corporal e estatura para a idade. Os resultados indicaram baixa preval\u00eancia de baixa estatura: 1,6% para meninas e 1,3% para meninos. No entanto, EMC (excesso de massa corporal) foi encontrado em 29,7% das crian\u00e7as, sendo 27,6% em meninas e 32,3% em meninos. Nas crian\u00e7as at\u00e9 5 anos, EMC foi igual a 12,3% (10,9% em meninas e 13,25% em meninos). Na faixa et\u00e1ria de 5 a 10 anos, os resultados foram de 35,3% para as meninas e 40,1% para os meninos, sendo de 37,8% em todo o grupo. A preval\u00eancia de EMC para crian\u00e7as acima de 10 anos foi de 37,4% (32,5% em meninas e 43,0% em meninos). As preval\u00eancias de EMC encontradas em todas as faixas et\u00e1rias foram expressivas e o problema se agrava nas crian\u00e7as maiores e nos meninos.

Background Atrioventricular block (AVB) during pregnancy is rare. Case study for pregnancy with AVB have been reported but a consensus guideline for peripartum management has not been established. This study aimed to investigate cardiac and obstetric complications and outcomes in our pregnant women with AVB and share our management experience. Methods This was a retrospective study. We reviewed a total of 74 pregnant women with AVB who delivered at our tertiary care center in the past 10 years. The patients were categorized into four groups according to the degree of block. The data were analyzed and compared among the four groups of patients. Results Regarding the cardiac complications, the cardiac function level showed significant difference among patient groups. The higher NYHA class were observed in patients with higher degree AVB. Pacemaker was placed before delivery in 32/33 patients with III\u00b0 AVB, 8/25 patients with II\u00b0 AVB, and 0/16 patient with I\u00b0 AVB. Other types of arrhythmias except AVB were present in all groups of patients but more frequently observed in type I patients with II\u00b0 AVB. No other heart abnormalities were observed among the patient groups. Obstetric complications were found in 21 women (28.4%), including premature labor, premature rupture of membranes (PROM), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preeclampsia, etc. The incidence rate of fetal cardiac abnormalities was 6.58%. But no statistical difference was detected among four groups of patients for fetal and maternal complications and fetal cardiac abnormalities (P>0.05). Caesarean section was performed more in patients with high-degree AVB than in patients with low-degree AVB. No maternal or neonatal death in our cases. Conclusions Most women with AVB could achieve successful pregnancy and delivery. Patients with II\u00b0 AVB type II and III\u00b0 AVB should be monitored vigilantly during pregnancy and post-partum. Temporary pacing before delivery appeared to be beneficial for women with III\u00b0AVB, and accurate diagnosis and care by a multidisciplinary team was recommended.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0,

This study explores the level of Physics Problem Solving Skills (PPSS) of 54 first semester students (11 men and 43 women, age range 16-18 years) in basic physics course in the science and physics education study program at Universitas Bengkulu, Indonesia. In the first lecture, students learn the concept of one-dimensional motion includes uniformly accelerated motion and vertical motion, but the lecturer does not provide examples of problems and how to solve them. In the second lecture, students learn the concept of Newton\u2019s Law and its application, and the lecturer gives examples of problems and stages to solve them, however the lecturer does not emphasize that these stages are important procedures in solving physical problems. At the end of each lesson, students are given an essay Physics Problem Solving Skills test. Based on an analysis of student answers, it is known that in general the student PPSS level is still in the novice and transition categories.

One of the proposed mechanisms for this is a lower rate of guideline directed medical therapy (GDMT) use in the HF+ADRD population. The aim of this study is to determine the change in GDMT use before and after HFrEF hospitalization for patients with HF+ADRD. Methods: We used 100% Medicare Parts A and B and a random 40% sample of Part D to create a cohort of 397,680 fee-for-service beneficiaries with \u22651 hospitalization for HFrEF between 2012 and 2018. We used previously validated ICD-9/10 codes to define ADRD. We created 4 exposure groups for both evidenced-based beta-blockers (BB) and renin angiotensin system inhibitors (RASI): \u201ccontinued\u201d (on drug before and after hospitalization); \u201cinitiated\u201d (not on before, but on after); \u201cdiscontinued\u201d (on before, but not after) and \u201cnever started\u201d (not on before or after). Results: Rates of BB continuation (42% vs. 37%, pTable 1 ). Rates of BB discontinuation (13% vs. 10%, p Conclusions: Rates of BB/RASI continuation and initiation are higher among HFrEF patients without ADRD while rates of BB/RASI discontinuation and never starting are higher among HF+ADRD patients. Additional work is needed to understand why GDMT use is lower in patients with HF+ADRD and to determine whether, in this population, there are adverse outcomes associated with failing to receive GDMT,

container_title={}, abstract={Background: Cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin (DOX) is mediated through mitochondrial perturbations. SIRT1, an NAD + -dependent deacetylase, has been reported to promote cellular adaptation to metabolic imbalances in part via mitochondrial biogenesis. Hypothesis: SIRT1 in the cardiomyocyte counteracts DOX cardiotoxicity in vivo. Methods: Tamoxifen (Tam)-inducible cardiomyocyte-specific SIRT1 knockout mice (SIRT1 cKO) were used. At 2 months of age, mice received Tam to induce knockout, and mice without Cre recombinase served as wild type (WT). Both groups of mice were treated with DOX (4 IP injections of 5 mg/kg/week) starting at 3 months of age. Echocardiography was performed before and after DOX treatment. Cardiac tissues were sampled after the final DOX injection. H9c2 cardiomyocytes were used for in vitro analysis. Results: At baseline, there were no differences in left ventricular (LV) dimension, thickness, fractional shortening (FS), and ejection fraction (EF) between the groups. DOX significantly reduced FS, EF, and LV thickness in both groups of mice. However, FS and EF after DOX injections were lower in SIRT1 cKO than in WT (FS, 26% vs. 30%; EF, 59% vs. 65%, P Conclusions: The results suggested that SIRT1 in the cardiomyocyte counteracts DOX cardiotoxicity by preserving mitochondrial content in vivo. Enhanced degradation, but not impaired biogenesis, may be involved in mitochondrial depletion in SIRT1 cKO.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Current treatment recommendations are based primarily on case series and aging data published before newly available diagnostic techniques. These recommendations are limited in safety and effectiveness outcomes. This multicenter, retrospective cohort study describes the epidemiology and treatment outcomes of invasive bartonellosis among patients in the U.S. Methods Collaborating sites were selected from SERGE-45 (Southeastern Research Group Endeavor) research network. Data were collected through REDCap. Subjects were screened from adult patients with invasive bartonellosis diagnosis codes, positive Bartonella spp. serologies, PCR, 16/18S tests, cultures, and Karius\u00ae tests from blood or tissue between January 1, 2014, and September 1, 2021. Eligible patients had at least one positive test result, evidence of invasive bartonellosis, and received treatment for bartonellosis. Treatment failure was defined as admission or readmission while on treatment, mortality during treatment or within 30 days after end of treatment, required escalation or extended duration of therapy, premature discontinuation of therapy, or necessitated change in regimen. Those not meeting treatment failure criteria were considered treatment success. Results Of the 169 patients screened, 32 were included, with 19 having treatment success. Bartonella henselae was the most common causative pathogen (n = 31, 97%). Endocarditis was the most common invasive manifestation (n = 18, 56%). Treatment regimens are displayed in Table 1. Primary reasons for treatment failure included necessitated escalation of therapy during treatment course (n = 4, 30.8%) and discontinuation of therapy due to adverse effect (n = 4, 30.8%). Conclusion Doxycycline with rifampin was the most common treatment regimen for invasive bartonellosis, with extended durations used compared to often referenced 6-week courses for invasive infections. It is important to consider adverse drug effects, toxicities, and tolerability in patients being treated for invasive bartonellosis. Disclosures P.

Moreover, levels of cardiac sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase type 2a (SERCA2a) were upregulated in LQT2 heart extracts. We hypothesized that progesterone treatment upregulated SERCA2a expression, thereby reducing Ca2+-dependent arrhythmias in LQT2 rabbits. We therefore investigated the effect of progesterone on SERCA2a regulation in isolated cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocytes from neonatal (3- to 5-day-old) rabbits were isolated, cultured, and treated with progesterone and other pharmacological agents. Immunoblotting was performed on total cell lysates and sarcoplasmic reticulum-enriched membrane fractions for protein abundance, and mRNA transcripts were quantified using real-time PCR. The effect of progesterone on baseline Ca2+ transients and Ca2+ clearance was determined using digital imaging. Progesterone treatment increased the total pool of SERCA2a protein by slowing its degradation. Using various pharmacological inhibitors of degradation pathways, we showed that progesterone-associated degradation of SERCA2a involves ubiquitination, and progesterone significantly decreases the levels of ubiquitin-tagged SERCA2a polypeptides. Our digital imaging data revealed that progesterone significantly shortened the decay and duration of Ca2+ transients. Progesterone treatment increases protein levels and activity of SERCA2a. Progesterone stabilizes SERCA2a, in part, by decreasing the ubiquitination level of SERCA2a polypeptides.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

This article describes a pilot project set up at the University of Padua (Coccetta 2004) which through the use of the MCA system made a small corpus of \ufb01lm texts, the English Language Learning Oriented (ELLO) \ufb01lm corpus, more easily accessible to language learners and allowed them to investigate: a) how a speci\ufb01c language function (van Ek/Trim 1998a, 1998b, 2001) is enacted by a set of different language forms and b) the ways in which the various manifestations of this function perform in relation to the multimodal co-text in which they are produced.

Anticipating these transfers by identifying risk factors could encourage end-of-life discussions that may change decisions to transfer. The aim was to examine the feasibility of identifying an end-of-life risk profile among RACF residents using a predictive tool to better anticipate predictors of hospital transfers, death or poor composite outcome of hospitalisation and/or death after initial assessment. A retrospective cohort study of 373 permanent residents aged 65+ years was conducted using objective clinical factors from records in nine RACFs in metropolitan Sydney, Australia. In total, 26.8% died and 34.3% experienced a composite outcome. Cox proportional hazard regression models confirmed the feasibility of estimating the level of risk for death or a poor composite outcome. Knowing this should provide opportunities to initiate advance care planning in RACFs, facilitating decision making near the end of life. We conclude that the current structure of electronic RACF databases could be enhanced to enable comprehensive assessment of the risk of hospital re-attendance without admission.

data from a single centre heart failure rehabilitation programme, evaluating the effect of programme completion and improved functional capacity on morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. Design A retrospective longitudinal analysis of service outcomes. Setting A single-centre London based NHS trust. Participants Patients attending heart failure rehabilitation between 2016 and 2020. Intervention Patients participated in a 12-week heart failure rehabilitation programme with those completing \u22656 rehabilitation sessions classified as \u2018completers\u2019. Main Measures Pre and post 6-min walk tests measured improvement in physical ability, depicted by a meaningful increase in distance (\u226530 m). Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis was used to predict risk of event (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, heart failure readmission and death) between \u2018completers\u2019 and \u2018non-completers\u2019. Kaplan\u2013Meier Log rank was employed for \u2018completers\u2019, examining time to event between \u2018improvers\u2019 (6-min walk test \u226530 m) and \u2018non-improvers\u2019 (6-min walk test Results 137 patients (male 61%) attended heart failure rehabilitation over the 4-year period. 86% ( n = 117) of patients completed the programme. During the follow-up period, there were 25 events, including three deaths. There was no statistically significant difference in time to event between completers and non-completers, ( P = 0.563). Improvement in 6-min walk test results demonstrate some short-term benefit, however no long-term benefits in morbidity and mortality were seen ( P = 0.888). Conclusions Completion of heart failure rehabilitation is not associated with a lower risk of combined event in this study. Improved 6-min walk test appears to be associated with short-term advantage in event-free survival time.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

from membrane stretch represent one of the key elements in blood flow regulation in vascular smooth muscle. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of membrane stretch remain unclear. In this study, we provide evidence that a vanilloid receptor (TRPV) homologue, TRPV2 is expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, and demonstrate that it can be activated by membrane stretch. Cell swelling caused by hypotonic solutions activated a nonselective cation channel current (NSCC) and elevated intracellular Ca 2+ ([Ca 2+ ] i ) in freshly isolated cells from mouse aorta. Both of these signals were blocked by ruthenium red, an effective blocker of TRPVs. The absence of external Ca 2+ abolished this increase in [Ca 2+ ] i caused by the hypotonic stimulation and reduced the activation of NSCC. Significant immunoreactivity to mouse TRPV2 protein was detected in single mouse aortic myocytes. Moreover, the expression of TRPV2 was found in mesenteric and basilar arterial myocytes. Treatment of mouse aorta with TRPV2 antisense oligonucleotides resulted in suppression of hypotonic stimulation-induced activation of NSCC and elevation of [Ca 2+ ] i as well as marked inhibition of TRPV2 protein expression. In Chinese hamster ovary K1 (CHO) cells transfected with TRPV2 cDNA (TRPV2-CHO), application of membrane stretch through the recording pipette and hypotonic stimulation consistently activated single NSCC. Moreover, stretch of TRPV2-CHO cells cultured on an elastic silicon membrane significantly elevated [Ca 2+ ] i . These results provide a strong basis for our purpose that endogenous TRPV2 in mouse vascular myocytes functions as a novel and important stretch sensor in vascular smooth muscles.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Physiology (medical)\", \"Physiology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [51, 0, 1292], "string": "title={Life before the Clock: Modeling Circadian Evolution}, container_title={}, abstract={A feedback loop that functions via transcription and translation is thought to be the mechanistic core of circadian rhythmicity.

Several issues remain problematic, including the lack of precise quantitative kinetics and the likely existence of additional, as-yet-undiscovered components. Even without these complications, models and flow charts of the circadian system have reached high complexity. They attempt to reconcile all observations without violating current views and concepts. In this article, the authors consider the mechanisms that may have preceded the circadian system in evolution. Given that cellular metabolism and biochemistry were presumably already interconnected in cascading feedback reactions prior to the appendage of the transcription/translation feedback loop, a coordinated response to exogenous changes would be advantageous over unsystematic responses.

treatment. Objective: To describe lessons learned from implementing the COPE (Creating Opportunities for Personal Empowerment) program in a community mental health practice as part of an evidence-based practice change to improve an advanced practice psychiatric nurse\u2019s clinical practice and provide treatment for depressed teens. Design: A preexperimental one-group pre- and posttest design was used to assess the feasibility and effects of a brief manualized seven-session cognitive-behavioral skills\u2013building intervention titled COPE delivered to 15 depressed adolescents in routine 30-minute mental health medication management outpatient visits. Results: Applying the evidence-based practice model led to improved adolescent outcomes. Adolescents reported significant decreases in depression, anxiety, anger, and destructive behavior as well as increases in self-concept and personal beliefs about managing negative emotions. Challenges (limited organizational resources) needed to be addressed to implement the advanced practice psychiatric nurse\u2019s evidence-based practice change. Conclusions: COPE is a promising brief cognitive-behavioral therapy\u2013based intervention that can be delivered within 30-minute individual outpatient visits. With this intervention, advanced practice nurses can work with current practice limitations and still provide evidence-based treatment for depressed teens. Collaboration between research-focused and clinically based nursing colleagues is a model of clinical scholarship that holds great promise in bridging the gap between research and practice.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Atmospheric Science\"]", "language": "en", "length": [74, 36, 0], "string": "title={Effect of cloudiness on long-term variability in air temperature in Krakow}, container_title={International Journal of Climatology}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [30, 0, 0], "string": "title={ANTIBIOTIC-INDUCED CONVULSIONS}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Electrical and Electronic Engineering\", \"Condensed Matter Physics\", \"Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials\"]", "language": "en", "length": [128, 0, 0], "string": "title={Fabrication of Micro-lens Arrays Based on Ink-jet Printing and Photolithographic Hole Templates for Integral Imaging 3-D Display}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Anthropology\", \"Cultural Studies\"]", "language": "it", "length": [78, 0, 0], "string": "title={Streghe e folletti.

In this vein, we theorize Russian model of the digital divide, approaching it through three main angles: state regulation of digitalization processes in Russia on federal and regional levels; different modes of the digital technology use in a cross-regional comparative perspective; and specific mechanisms for the analysis and further overcoming digital divide in Russia. For the latter point, we propose a \u2018digital passport\u2019 of the Russian regions that allows for better understanding of the digitalization progress in particular regions of the country and for more efficient policy-making on site.

\u201chigh-risk\u201d features are controversial based on lack of consensus as to what constitutes \u201chigh-risk\u201d, and variable results of small retrospective studies. The EORTC 22922 and MA20 trials reporting improved 10-year disease-free survival with nodal irradiation included high-risk N0 patients but these patients were not analyzed separately and did not receive modern systemic therapy. We sought to evaluate long-term locoregional control in T1-T2N0 patients with high-risk features undergoing mastectomy in the contemporary era. Methods: We retrospectively identified patients with T1-T2N0 breast cancer with \u22651 high-risk feature treated with mastectomy from 1/2006-12/2011. High-risk features were defined as age &lt;40 years, multifocal/multicentric disease, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), medial or central tumor location, and high nuclear grade. The primary outcome of interest was rate of LRR. Results: Among 672 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 187 (28%) had 1 risk factor: 21 (3%) were age &lt;40 years, 132 (20%) were multifocal/multicentric, and 34 (5%) had LVI; 449 (67%) patients had \u22652 high-risk features, and 36 patients with unknown grade were excluded from risk analysis. PMRT was received by only 15 (2%) patients. Clinicopathologic characteristics of the 657 patients treated without PMRT are shown in Table 1.

A median of 4 lymph nodes were retrieved (range 1-15). Adjuvant systemic therapy was received by 86% of patients. At median 5.6 years of follow-up, overall LRR rate was 4.7% (n = 31), with the majority (55%) of events involving the chest wall. Increasing tumor size was associated with LRR (HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.26\u20132.29, p = 0.006), while age, histology, grade, subtype, LVI, multifocality/multicentricity, and tumor location were not (all p &gt; 0.05). Although rate of LRR increased from 3.8% to 9.4% with 1 vs. \u22654 high-risk features, a comparison of 1 vs. 2 vs. 3 vs. \u22654 risk factors was not significant by Kaplan-Meier estimation (p = 0.54). Conclusions: A low LRR rate of 4.7% was seen in this large unselected cohort of T1-T2N0 cancers with \"high-risk\" features treated by mastectomy and systemic therapy without PMRT. While increasing tumor size was predictive, other features did not confer a higher risk of LRR either independently or together, and do not by themselves mandate the use of PMRT in this population.

Despite the convenience of spontaneous indices, their relation to the arterial baroreflex remains unclear. Therefore, in 97 volunteers, we derived 5 proposed indices (sequence method, \u03b1-index, transfer function, low-frequency transfer function, and impulse response function), compared them with arterial baroreflex gain (by the modified Oxford pharmacologic technique), and examined their relation to carotid distensibility and respiratory sinus arrhythmia. The subjects comprised men and women (n=41) aged 25 to 86 years, 30% of whom had established coronary artery disease. Generally, the indices were correlated with each other (except \u03b1-index and low-frequency transfer function) and with baroreflex gain. However, the Bland-Altman method demonstrated that the spontaneous indices had limits of agreement as large as the baroreflex gain itself. Even in individuals within the lowest tertile of baroreflex gain for whom baroreflex gain appears to be the most clinically relevant, spontaneous indices failed to relate to baroreflex gain. In fact, for these individuals, there was no correlation between any index and baroreflex gain. Forward stepwise linear regression showed that all spontaneous indices and baroreflex gain were related to respiratory sinus arrhythmia, but only baroreflex gain was related to carotid distensibility. Therefore, these data suggest that spontaneous indices are inadequate estimates of gain and are inconsistent with arterial baroreflex function.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Scale (MDS-UPDRS-III) has limited applicability for the assessment of motor fluctuations in the home setting. Methods: To assess whether a self-administered, tablet-based application can reliably quantify differences in motor performance using two-target finger tapping and forearm pronation-supination tasks in the ON (maximal dopaminergic medication efficacy) and OFF (reemergence of parkinsonian deficits) medication states, we recruited 11 Parkinson disease (PD) patients (age, 60.6 \u00b1 9.0 years; disease duration, 12.8 \u00b1 4.1 years) and 11 healthy age-matched controls (age, 62.5 \u00b1 10.5 years). The total number of taps, tap interval, tap duration, and tap accuracy were algorithmically calculated by the application, using the more affected side in patients and the dominant hand in healthy controls. Results: Compared to the OFF state, PD patients showed a higher number of taps (84.2 \u00b1 20.3 vs. 54.9 \u00b1 26.9 taps; p = 0.0036) and a shorter tap interval (375.3 \u00b1 97.2 vs. 708.2 \u00b1 412.8 ms; p = 0.0146) but poorer tap accuracy (2,008.4 \u00b1 995.7 vs. 1,111.8 \u00b1 901.3 pixels; p = 0.0055) for the two-target task in the ON state, unaffected by the magnitude of coexistent dyskinesia. Overall, test-retest reliability was high (r &#x3e;0.75) and the discriminatory ability between OFF and ON states was good (0.60 \u2264 AUC \u2264 0.82). The correlations between tapping data and MDS-UPDRS-III scores were only moderate (\u20130.55 to 0.55). Conclusions: A self-administered, tablet-based application can reliably distinguish between OFF and ON states in fluctuating PD patients and may be sensitive to additional motor phenomena, such as accuracy, not captured by the MDS-UPDRS-III.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cell Biology\", \"Molecular Biology\", \"Biochemistry\"]", "language": "en", "length": [124, 32, 0], "string": "title={Horseradish peroxidase binding to intestinal brush-border membranes ofCyprinus carpio.

This lack of examination of redundancy from a psychological approach was a state which Hartley and Cooper felt should be remedied. And, in the title of their paper, they pose an implicit question by the inclusion of a question mark \u2014 \u2018Redundancy: a psychological problem?\u2019. Yet, as Wood notes, there is in fact little specification of either the potential or reported psychological effects of redundancy. Hartley and Cooper document the reported impact of redundancy in terms of the various stages of the process and note that most studies have tended to concentrate on the period of unemployment following the loss of the job rather than on the period previous to the redundancy. A number of these studies, they note, have been attitudinal, describing the feelings of the affected population, or a sub\u2010sample, towards a number of relevant issues, most notably the redundancy itself. While they consider that the issue of redundancy has been studied from the viewpoints of both labour economics and sociology, Hartley and Cooper are more concerned to highlight the lack of concern displayed so far by psychologists. They quote the study of the closure of a steel works by Warr and Lovatt, in which psychological wellbeing was singled out for examination and was found to be associated with length of time unemployed. This study is, however, exceptional in the emphasis placed on the psychological effects of redundancy. Hartley and Cooper go on to comment on the central place given in previous studies to the job search process, both in terms of attitudes and behavioural patterns. From job search, attention is directed to a review of the studies of the unemployed in general as opposed to the redundant in particular.

Plasma diagnostics was performed using X-ray spectra of H- and He-like Mg ions. VUV spectra of Fe ions were recorded in the wavelength range 15 \u2013 150 \u00c5 As a result, the change in the structure of the VUV spectra of Fe ions as a function of T e in the range of 100 \u2013 400 eV was studied.

calorie availability in the Brazilian population. The study used data from the 2002-2003 Brazilian Household Budget Survey. The calorie requirement for a reference adult individual was based on the mean requirements for adult males and females (2,550kcal/day). The conversion factors were defined as the ratios between the calorie requirements for each age group and gender and that of the reference adult. The adult-equivalent calorie availability levels were higher than the per capita levels, with the largest differences in rural and low-income households. Differences in household calorie availability varied from 22kcal/day (households with adults and an adolescent) to 428kcal/day (households with elderly individuals), thus showing that per capital measurements can underestimate the real calorie availability, since they overlook differences in household composition.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

From Deep, Low-Pressure Wells}, container_title={}, abstract={With this unique chamber system, which involves automatic cycle control and a separate tubing string for venting the formation gas, it is possible to achieve gas-lift production rates of 1,000 BID from 10,000 feet at low flowing bottom-hole pressures. In a field test oil four wells, production increased immediately in three of the wells, and more gradually in the fourth. Introduction The Automatic Vent Chamber (AVC) System was developed to overcome the disadvantages inherent in using deep, high-volume lift systems such as large-beam, hydraulic, or electric submersible pumps. These systems require a large initial capital investment and are often expensive to operate and maintain - especially in wells with high gas/liquid ratios or sandy conditions. The capital investment required for an AVC system is especially attractive when there is gas compression equipment already on the lease. Gas-lift systems have proved to be an extremely flexible and economical means of lifting fluid from deep wells, particularly from those with high flowing bottom-hole pressures. However, means of lifting large volumes of fluid from deep, low-formation pressure wells have been limited, Conventional pressure wells have been limited, Conventional chambers have been used with good results, but these systems also have volume limitations. With the advent of the AVC system, a whole new realm of artificial lift was introduced. It is actually two system in one. The chamber system automatically pumps liquids from the chamber to the producing tubing where the upper standing valve producing tubing where the upper standing valve retains the liquid. It then vents the chamber, allowing it to refill. The gas-lift system above the chamber lifts the liquid from the upper standing valve to the surface. Thus the chamber is refilling while the previous chamber load is being lifted by the gas-lift previous chamber load is being lifted by the gas-lift system. Of course, while the chamber is refilling, formation gas is being Produced through the chamber and up the vent tubing. This eliminates the problems experienced with conventional chambers in gaseous wells. The chamber cycles repeat at a rate equal to the well's producing capability. The tubing cycles repeat with each one or two chamber cycles. In summary, the AVC system provides an automatic chamber that can handle formation gas with case and achieve a lower bottom-hole pressure than was ever before possible with gas lift. As with any chamber application, wells with high productivity indices (PI's) are the best candidates, productivity indices (PI's) are the best candidates, but in offshore fields, in subsea work, or on city lots where gas lift is a practical necessity, the AVC system may be economically applied to wells with high bottom-hole pressures and medium to low Pi's. it is felt that the system is particularly suited to fields undergoing secondary recovery. Production History Production History Four wells have been equipped with AVC systems and each illustrates the effectiveness of the system. Table 1 shows the production history of each well for several months. Each well was equipped with 2 7/8-in. production tubing and 1.900-in. OD vent tubing.

On the other hand, the importance of oxidative stress and inflammation has been emphasized in disorders that involve the neurodegenerative processes such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). A growing number of reports have demonstrated the increased expression of kinin receptors in neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, the effect of bradykinin and des-Arg10-kallidin, two representative kinin peptides, was analyzed with respect to inflammatory response and induction of oxidative stress in a PD cellular model, obtained after stimulation of differentiated SK-N-SH cells with a neurotoxin, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium. Kinin peptides caused an increased cytokine release and enhanced production of reactive oxygen species and NO by cells. These changes were accompanied by a loss of cell viability and a greater activation of caspases involved in apoptosis progression. Moreover, the neurotoxin and kinin peptides altered the dopamine receptor 2 expression. Kinin receptor expression was also changed by the neurotoxin. These results suggest a mediatory role of kinin peptides in the development of neurodegeneration and may offer new possibilities for its regulation by using specific antagonists of kinin receptors.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Theoretical Computer Science\"]", "language": "en", "length": [65, 0, 0], "string": "title={Management of Railroad Impedances for Shortest Path-based Routing}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Electrical and Electronic Engineering\"]", "language": "en", "length": [86, 0, 0], "string": "title={Optimal radiation pattern of an array in the presence of two directional interferences}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Demography\"]", "language": "en", "length": [66, 0, 1089], "string": "title={Prenatal health investment decisions: Does the child\u2019s sex matter?}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Individuals invest in their own health, but children rely on parents to act on their behalf, especially in the case of prenatal health.

In this paper, we propose a robust algorithm to detect cracks in a pixel-wise manner from real concrete surface images. In practice, crack detection remains challenging in the following aspects: (1) detection performance is disturbed by noises and clutters of environment; and (2) the requirement of high pixel-wise accuracy is difficult to obtain. To address these limitations, three steps are considered in the proposed scheme. First, a local pattern predictor (LPP) is constructed using convolutional neural networks (CNN), which can extract discriminative features of images. Second, each pixel is efficiently classified into crack categories or non-crack categories by LPP, using as context a patch centered on the pixel. Lastly, the output of CNN\u2014i.e., confidence map\u2014is post-processed to obtain the crack areas. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on samples captured from several concrete bridges.

of this study was to describe the cytogenetic observations on abnormal human pregnancies (anembryonic pregnancy, early fetal loss, and hydatidiform moles), and to detect the most frequent or typical chromosomal aberration for anembryonic pregnancy and early fetal loss. Study Design: Abnormal pregnancies were divided into three clinical and morphological groups: (a) anembryonic pregnancy; (b) early fetal loss, and (c) hydatidiform mole. Of the 119 karyotyped tissue samples, 42 (35%) were from anembryonic pregnancies, 64 (54%) from early fetal losses, and 13 (11%) were from hydatidiform moles (6 complete and 7 partial moles). Long-term cultures of chorionic villi and GTG-banding techniques were used for chromosome analysis. Results and Conclusion: The overall frequency of chromosome anomalies among the 119 karyotyped spontaneous abortions was found to be 37.8%. Trisomy (double trisomy included) accounted for 35.6% of all aberrations, followed by polyploidy (33.3%), mosaicism (11.1%), tructural abnormalities (4.4%), and monosomy X (2.2%). Although the difference was not statistically significant, single trisomy was the predominant chromosome abnormality found in anembryonic pregnancies (64.3%) while in cases of early fetal loss, trisomy (double trisomy included) (38.9%) and triploidy (27.8%) were quite frequently present.

However, timely judgment process and outcome feedback are available and may improve the quality of an auditor's conclusions over time. Therefore, to test for the benefits of task-specific experience, I compare loan judgments provided by inexperienced seniors, experienced managers, and more experienced junior partners and senior managers to a criterion based on the conclusions of senior audit partners. While previous research usually does not indicate performance improvements beyond the level of an audit senior (e.g., Tan and Libby 1997) for this complex task with timely feedback, consistent and substantial performance improvements are reported here.

Despite high rates of hematologic and cytogenetic responses to Glivec therapy, the emergence of resistance to Glivec has been recognized as a major problem in the treatment of CML. Those problems leaded us to search for novel therapy, combining curcumin with Glivec. Recently we reported that curcumin induced apoptosis via repression of p-AKT and activation of caspase-3. To investigate whether combination of curcumin with Glivec is more effective than Glivec alone, the expression of apoptosis related genes, such as Bcl-2 family, caspase-3, and its cell cycle proteins, such as p53, p21, cyclin D, cyclin A, cyclin B1 and PCNA were examined by western analysis in K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cell line. Our results showed that Bcl-2, -XL, and Bid were more down-regulated with combined treatment compared with single treatment controls (either Glivec or curcumin alone). Also, the activity of caspase 3 was 2-fold higher than compared with control groups. In western analysis, procaspase 3 was dramatically reduced with combined treatment. Also, cell cycle proteins except p53 were more down-regulated in combined treatment. For further investigation of the genes affected by combination therapy, DNA chip analysis was performed. The expression of candidate genes, which we selected in chip analysis, was confirmed using real-time PCR. Our result indicated that apoptosis related genes were up-regulated and cyclin D1 and cyclin A were down-regulated. Also, several genes (protein phosphatase 2C, ZNF272, protein-tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor 7 (PTPN7), SOCS2) were more down-regulated in combined treatment, showing 2-fold difference. Those genes may be associated with the progression of chronic myeloid leukemia. We suggest that their down-regulation by combined treatment was effective mainly via the induction of apoptosis. Taken together, our data suggested that combined treatment with curcumin could be effective to overcome the problems of Imatinib mesylate (Glivec, STI571) therapy.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0,

In this study, Dermacentor everestianus (n = 646) and Haemaphysalis qinghaiensis (n = 172) ticks were collected from yaks (Bos grunniens) in Shiqu county, eastern Tibetan Plateau, China. SFG rickettsiae were identified and characterized in these ticks. A total of 49.9% (408/818) ticks were infected by Rickettsia spp. with infection rates of 58.1% (100/172) and 46.7% (308/646) detected in H. qinghaiensis and D. everestianus ticks, respectively. Furthermore, 95% of Rickettsia spp. were Rickettsia raoultii-like bacteria, and 5% were related to Candidatus Rickettsia longicornii. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that SFG rickettsiae infections were firstly reported in Shiqu county for these tick species. Our results indicated that H. qinghaiensis and D. everestianus ticks from Shiqu county became highly infected with a R. raoultii-like bacteria during their feeding process. This observation is alarming because of the zoonotic potentiality of these species. Overall, the present study detected a widespread of R. raoultii-like bacteria in ticks that are considered a serious threat to domestic animals and humans in Shiqu county.

tumors, only few studies compared delineation based on PET/CT with pathologic examination. Aim of our study was to compare anatomic imaging modalities including computed tomography (CT), esophagram, endoscopy with FDG PET/CT for delineation of gross tumor volume (GTV) in esophageal carcinoma and to validate the results with the pathologic examination. Methods: Thirty patients with stages II-III squamous cell carcinoma underwent transthoracic esophagectomy were enrolled. PET/CT, esophagram and endoscopy were performed with patients before operations. The length of the lesion on the PET/CT scan and on the CT portion of the PET/CT and the PET scan alone was determined independently by 3 separate investigative groups. PET/CT scan was evaluated by visual inspection for abnormality. A standard uptake value (SUV) of 2.5 was used in the PET scan to delineate the tumor extent. The lengths of GTVs determined with the five modalities (PET/CT, PET, CT, esophagram and endoscopy) were compared quantitatively and validated with the pathologic specimen. The sizes of the tumors were measured by pathologic examination which was considered as the gold standard. Results: Of the 30 patients, 9 had T2 tumors, 20 had T3 tumors and 1 had T4 tumor with an involvement of pleura. Three tumors were located at the upper esophagus, 14 at the middle esophagus, 13 at the lower esophagus. The mean length of the carcinoma was 5.85cm(SD 2.50cm) measured by pathologic examination, 5.79cm (SD 2.04cm) as determined by PET scan, 5.14cm (SD 1.65cm) by PET/CT scan, 5.42 cm(SD 2.42cm)by CT scan, 5.50cm(SD 2.79cm) by endoscopy, and 6.07cm(SD 2.75cm) by esophagram respectively. Although the lengths of the tumors as measured by the five imaging modalities were no significant difference, the result of PET was the most accurate. Conclusions: Compared with tumor lengths measured by pathologic examination, PET with a SUV 2.5 was found to be the most accurate modality and can help the radiation oncologist delineate the GTV of esophageal carcinoma precisely.

Here, we review the evidence that endothelins (ETs) synthesized within the adrenal cortex may act as autocrine and/or paracrine factors to regulate adrenocortical cell activity. The expression of ETs has been detected in normal, hyperplastic and neoplastic adrenocortical cells. The occurrence of ET receptors has been described in the different zones of the cortex. ETs stimulate the secretion of both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, and modulate the proliferation of adrenocortical cells. The effects of ETs on steroidogenic cells are mediated through the activation of various signaling mechanisms including stimulation of phospholipase C, phospholipase A2 and adenylyl cyclase activity, as well as calcium influx through plasma channels. These observations suggest that locally produced ETs may play an important role in the regulation of corticosteroid secretion and in the control of mitogenesis in normal and tumoral adrenocortical

This article questions this assertion by examining distinct forms of inequity between workers in unionised workplaces and, more specifically, the role of collective bargaining in creating, maintaining, reducing or avoiding them. Based on a study conducted in Australia, Canada (Qu\u00e9bec), Denmark and France, the situations of inequity examined are related to employment and working conditions, and favour one group of workers over another group of workers performing the same tasks in the same workplace. To better apprehend these dynamics and distinguish between different situations, we develop an analytical framework to capture them. Then, we focus on one example observable in each country: two examples of inequity based on date of hiring (Canada and Australia) and two based on employment status (France and Denmark), showing how the four ideal-type processes interact in each national context. Based on an analysis of these examples, we demonstrate the segmentation between core and non-core employees, along the lines of segmentation theory, but also within groups of insiders or core employees and the key factors that explain how the collective bargaining process can lead to inequity: time, balance of power, and workplace institutions.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Organic Chemistry\", \"Polymers and Plastics\", \"Biochemistry\", \"Bioengineering\"]", "language": "en", "length": [140, 0, 0], "string": "title={Bioactive nanomembranes of semiconductor polythiophene and thermoplastic polyurethane: thermal, nanostructural and nanomechanical properties}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cell Biology\", \"Hematology\", \"Immunology\", \"Biochemistry\"]", "language": "en", "length": [98, 0, 3307], "string": "title={Imatinib Mesylate Reduces Plexiform Neurofibromas by Targeting the Hematopoietic Microenvironment.}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Von Recklinghausen\u2019s neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common genetic disease in man with a predisposition to cancer, a disorder caused by mutations of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene that functions as a GTPase for p21ras. Affected individuals are predisposed to plexiform neurofibromas, congenital tumors that arise from cranial and peripheral nerves for which no effective therapies are available. We have recently utilized a genetically engineered murine model to demonstrate that mast cells and the c-kit/kitL pathway have a key role in plexiform neurofibroma formation. In the present study, we utilized this model to determine whether imatinib mesylate, an FDA approved drug that targets the c-kit ligand in mast cells and other cell lineages in the tumor microenvironment in inducing tumor regression. Krox20; Nf1flox/\u2212 mice begin to develop plexiform neurofibromas by 6 months of age, especially in the dorsal root ganglia involving the sciatic nerve. Fluoridinated PET/CT images were utilized to verify that experimental mice had developed plexiform neurofibromas and to evaluate tumor progression. Following a 12 week treatment, Krox20; Nf1flox/\u2212 mice who received the vehicle had an increase in FDG uptake in the tumor growth area. In contrast, mice received imatinib mesylate had a dramatic reduction in the FDG uptake. At autopsy, the spinal cords were examined and sections were prepared for histologic examination. Grossly, tumors from the vehicle control treated mice were consistent with plexiform neurofibromas, as previously described (Zhu, Science 2002). In contrast, dissection of the spinal cords from Gleevec treated mice revealed that the mean volume of the tumor was significantly reduced. In addition, though there is still hyperplasia observed in the dorsal root ganglia from imatinib mesylate treated mice, the overall architecture of the nerve is improved as compared to the hematoxylin and eosin stained sections from the placebo treated control. Serial sections from 10 tumors isolated from placebo treated mice and serial sections from all dorsal root ganglia in the FDG positive affected regions of imatinib mesylate treated sections were scored. There is variability in the number of mast cells from the placebo treated tumors. However, there is a consistent, significant reduction in the number of mast cells scored in the dorsal root ganglia from the imatinib mesylate treated mice, suggesting that imatinib mesylate is inhibiting the c-kit receptor kinase and thus reducing mast cell numbers in the neurofibroma. Finally, since there are anatomic reductions in tumor size of imatinib mesylate treated mice as compared to placebo control treated animals, we hypothesized that the FDG affected regions would have an increase in apoptosis as compared to the amount of apoptosis observed in tumors from placebo treated mice. While only rare TUNEL positive cells were observed in tumors treated with the placebo, up to 10% of cells were TUNEL positive in tumors received imatinib mesylate. Collectively, these studies provide direct evidence that targeting the microenvironment induces regression of a plexiform neurofibromas and provides the basis for conducting clinical trials for a tumor that affects approximately 10\u201315 thousand patients in the US alone.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0,

Results show that higher acrylonitrile type of copolymers give cured Vinylite-rubber blends with higher tensile strength, higher 100 per cent modulus, and greater ultimate elongation to break than low acrylonitrile copolymers. 3. The low temperature properties of the cured blends improve as the acrylonitrile content of the synthetic rubber is reduced. 4. An effective cure at 287\u00b0 F is obtained in 15 to 30 minutes by using 2 parts of accelerator and 2 parts of sulfur per hundred parts of 1,3-butadieneacrylonitrile type copolymer-Vinylite blends. Added amounts of sulfur, and accelerator did not improve the properties or decrease the cure time at 287\u00b0 F. 5. Some of the cured blends studied are free of tackiness at temperatures as high as 230\u00b0 F. 6. Some stabilizers for vinyls tested as well as sodium acetate can be used to activate sulfur cures in 1,3-butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymer-Vinylite blends to formulate light-colored transparent

It is activated by the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and Ras on the membrane, regulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway for the cell growth and proliferation. PI3K\u03b1 is an obligate dimer with p110\u03b1 catalytic subunit and p85\u03b1 regulatory subunit. Their interactions stabilize and maintain PI3K\u03b1 in the inactive state. At the molecular level, the activation of PI3K\u03b1 requires two events, (i) the release of nSH2 by phosphorylated tyrosine (pY) motif in the RTK and (ii) the membrane localization facilitated by Ras. The mechanism of PI3K\u03b1 activation at the atomic level suggests that PI3K\u03b1 undergoes the significant conformational change upon nSH2 release. The iSH2 in p85\u03b1 subunit moves, which facilitates the membrane interactions and catalysis. The activation loop (a-loop) in the kinase domain becomes more flexible, exposing the basic residues for the substrate binding. The activation mechanism expedites our understanding of the PI3K autoinhibition, activation, and catalysis. By collecting and analyzing the available PI3K structures, we have identified the structural features that distinguish the inactive and active class IA PI3Ks. The a-loop is \u201ccollapsed\u201d with k\u03b111 in the regulatory arch \u201cIN\u201d in the inactive PI3Ks. Upon activation, the a-loop becomes \u201cextended\u201d and k\u03b111 moves \u201cOUT\u201d. These features provide the functional explanations for both hotspot and weak oncogenic mutations and indicate their additive effects. The mechanism reveals a principle for PI3K allosteric drug discovery. The inhibitors that may modulate the iSH2 dynamics can allosterically prevent PI3K activation in the signaling pathways.

weekend when compared to that of a weekday. Clearly multifactorial, this effect remains incompletely understood and variable in different clinical contexts. In this study we analyse factors relevant to the weekend effect in elective lower-limb joint replacement at a large NHS multispecialty academic healthcare centre. Materials and Methods We reviewed the electronic medical records of 352 consecutive patients who received an elective primary hip or knee arthroplasty. Patient, clinical and time-related variables were extracted from the records. The data were anonymised, then processed using a combination of uni- and multivariate statistics. Results There is a significant association between the selected weekend effect outcome measure (postoperative length of stay) and patient age, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, time to first postoperative physiotherapy and time to postoperative radiography but not day of the week of operation. Discussion We were not able to demonstrate a weekend effect in elective lower-limb joint replacement at our institution nor identify a factor that would require additional weekend clinical medical staffing. Rather, resource priorities would seem to include measures to optimise at-risk patients preoperatively and measures to reduce time to physiotherapy and radiography postoperatively. Conclusions Our findings imply that postoperative length of stay could be minimised by strategies relating to patient selection and access to postoperative services. We have also identified a powerful statistical methodology that could be applied to other service evaluations in different clinical contexts.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Physical activity was assessed by the number of walking steps determined by using a triaxial accelerometer, mobility function by the Timed Up and Go test, muscle strength by the grasping power test, and HRQOL by the Medical Outcome Study 36-Item Short Form Survey v2.ResultsIn the temporary housing group, reduced physical activity and correlation between physical activity and mobility function in men, and muscle strength in both men and women, were observed. There was no significant difference in HRQOL between groups except for bodily pain in women.ConclusionSupport for older evacuees should focus on maintaining their physical activity level as well as on HRQOL to avoid deterioration of health in these survivors.

It has been established that chronic hyperammonaemia, whether caused by portacaval shunting or other means, leads to a variety of metabolic changes, including a depression in the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRGlc) increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier to neutral amino acids, and an increase in the brain content of aromatic amino acids. The preceding paper [Jessy, DeJoseph & Hawkins (1991) Biochem. J. 277, 693-696] showed that the depression in CMRGlc caused by hyperammonaemia correlated more closely with glutamine, a metabolite of ammonia, than with ammonia itself. This suggested that ammonia (NH3 and NH4+) was without effect. The present experiments address the question whether ammonia, in the absence of net glutamine synthesis, induces any of the metabolic symptoms of cerebral dysfunction associated with hyperammonaemia. 2. Small doses of methionine sulphoximine, an inhibitor of glutamine synthetase, were used to raise the plasma ammonia levels of normal rats without increasing the brain glutamine content. These hyperammonaemic rats, with plasma and brain ammonia levels equivalent to those known to depress brain function, behaved normally over 48 h. There was no depression of cerebral energy metabolism (i.e. the rate of glucose consumption). Contents of key intermediary metabolites and high-energy phosphates were normal. Neutral amino acid transport (tryptophan and leucine) and the brain contents of aromatic amino acids were unchanged. 3. The data suggest that ammonia is without effect at concentrations less than 1 mumol/ml if it is not converted into glutamine.

Therefore, it is necessary to make sure there is a sufficient power supply to balance the demand and supply curve and meet people\u2019s demands. The work done in this paper aims to minimize the daily operating cost of the hybrid microgrid while incorporating a demand response strategy built on an incentive-based demand response (IBDR) model. Three case studies were constructed and analyzed to derive the best, most reduced daily operational cost. This was achieved using the CPLEX solver embedded in algebraic modeling language in the Advanced Interactive Multidimensional Modeling Systems (AIMMS) software with multi-agent system (MAS); the MAS was used to make sure that the developed intelligent-based agents work independently to achieve an optimal microgrid system. The sensitivity analysis employed established that case study 2 gave the most reduced daily operation cost (USD 119), which represents an 8% reduction in the daily operational cost from case study 1 and a 9% reduction from case study 3. Then, we achieved 17% and 25% reductions, as compared to specific other approaches.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cancer Research\", \"Oncology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [116, 0, 0], "string": "title={Differential behavior of NF\u2011\u03baB, I\u03baB\u03b1 and EGFR during the renal carcinogenic process in an experimental model in\ufffdvivo}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Developmental Biology\", \"Genetics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [156, 0, 703], "string": "title={The protein encoded by the proto-oncogene DEK changes the topology of chromatin and reduces the efficiency of DNA replication in a chromatin-specific manner}, container_title={}, abstract={The structure of chromatin regulates the genetic activity of the underlying DNA sequence.

This coreceptor switch is correlated with an accelerated progression. However, those that maintain virus exclusively restricted to CCR5 (R5) also develop AIDS. We have previously reported that R5 variants in these \"non-switch virus\" patients evolve during disease progression towards a more replicative phenotype exhibiting altered CCR5 coreceptor interactions. DC-SIGN is a C-type lectin expressed by dendritic cells that HIV-1 may bind and utilize for enhanced infection of T cells in trans. To further explore the evolution of the R5 phenotype we analyzed sequential R5 isolates obtained before and after AIDS onset, i.e. at the chronic stage and during end-stage disease, with regard to efficiency of DC-SIGN use in trans-infections. Results Results from binding and trans-infection assays showed that R5 viruses emerging during end-stage AIDS disease displayed reduced ability to use DC-SIGN. To better understand viral determinants underlying altered DC-SIGN usage by R5 viruses, we cloned and sequenced the HIV-1 env gene. We found that end-stage R5 viruses lacked potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS) in the gp120 V2 and V4 regions, which were present in the majority of the chronic stage R5 variants. One of these sites, amino acid position 160 (aa160) in the V2 region, also correlated with efficient use of DC-SIGN for binding and trans-infections. In fitness assays, where head-to-head competitions between chronic stage and AIDS R5 viruses were setup in parallel direct and DC-SIGN-mediated infections, results were further supported. Competitions revealed that R5 viruses obtained before AIDS onset, containing the V2 PNGS at aa160, were selected for in the trans-infection. Whereas, in agreement with our previous studies, the opposite was seen in direct target cell infections where end-stage viruses out-competed the chronic stage viruses. Conclusion Results of our study suggest R5 virus variants with diverse fitness for direct and DC-SIGN-mediated trans-infections evolve within infected individuals at end-stage disease. In addition, our results point to the importance of a glycosylation site within the gp120 V2 region for efficient DC-SIGN use of HIV-1 R5 viruses.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Biomedical Engineering\", \"Internal Medicine\", \"Rehabilitation\"]", "language": "en", "length": [94, 0, 0], "string": "title={Analysis of Viscoelastic Properties of Wrist Joint for Quantification of Parkinsonian Rigidity}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Modeling and Simulation\"]", "language": "en", "length": [105, 0, 981], "string": "title={The Nonsequential Fusion Method for Localization from Unscented Kalman Filter by Multistation Array Buoys}, container_title={}, abstract={Based on special features of array buoy and the research field of location and tracking of underwater target, the research combines the highly adaptive nonlinear filtering algorithm unscented Kalman filter with the nonlinear programming of multistation array buoy positioning system.

Acromegaly is a rare chronic endocrine disorder that can lead to significant quality of life (QoL) impairment and persistent symptomatology in both biochemically uncontrolled as well as in cured or controlled patients. We aimed to conduct an observational cross-sectional study investigating the associations between biochemical disease control, associated comorbidities, and symptoms severity on QoL in a cohort of acromegalic patients. Methods Thirty-one patients with acromegaly were enrolled in our study. AcroQoL and PASQ (Pain assessed acromegaly symptoms questionnaire) questionnaires were applied to all patients. Information about disease status, associated comorbidities, and other relevant clinical and paraclinical data were gathered. Results Patients with uncontrolled acromegaly presented worse QoL and symptoms scores than controlled patients, but the difference was not statistically significant (AcroQoL 57.22 vs 64.04, p > 0.05; PASQ 12 vs 16.47, p > 0.05). Worse symptoms were significantly associated with impaired QoL (overall symptoms score on PASQ was negatively correlated with AcroQoL total score, r = \u2212 0.61, p p Conclusions Achieving biochemical control of acromegaly might not be enough to reverse the QoL impairment and improve symptomatology in acromegalic patients. While symptoms severity and the presence of cardiovascular complications seem to play an important role in reducing patients QoL, the roles of disease control, diabetes, and pituitary insufficiency are less clear.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite rebar offers a highly durable alternative to steel rebar. Research on the use of FRP rebar has been conducted over the past 40 years; however, its widespread application is yet to occur. This paper investigates the use of FRP as reinforcement, in particular the application to slab elements and associated performance at serviceability and ultimate limit state. Existing design guidance such as the ACI and CSA standards are reviewed and a number of slab designs with dimensions common in practice are undertaken. A third approach that follows the Eurocode design philosophy is also reviewed. The design of the different slab forms is assessed according to these codes, and results compared with the behaviour predicted by non-linear finite-element analysis. The relative costs of each resulting slab design are also discussed. The findings highlight differences in the relative accuracy of the different code recommendations and indicate the need for further research to exclude potentially non-conservative design. The work presented is intended to provide a contextual comparison of existing design approaches, which will be useful to practitioners involved in design of concrete structures with FRP rebar.}",

Among the US Transgender Population: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis, 2006\u20132017}, container_title={}, abstract={Background. Transgender women (transwomen) in the United States have been shown to have high HIV risk with Black and Hispanic transwomen being particularly vulnerable. Growing research on transgender men (transmen) also shows increased HIV risk and burden, although not as much is known for this transgender population. Objectives. This systematic review estimates the prevalence of self-reported and laboratory-confirmed HIV infection, reported sexual and injection behaviors, and contextual factors associated with HIV risk of transgender persons living in the United States. Search Methods. We searched the HIV Prevention Research Synthesis database and MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Sociological Abstracts databases from January 2006 to March 2017 and January 2006 to May 2017, respectively. Additional hand searches were conducted in December 2017 to obtain studies not found in the literature searches. Selection Criteria. Eligible reports were published US-based studies that included transgender persons and reported HIV status. Data collection and analysis. Data were double-coded and quality assessed. We used random-effects models employing the DerSimonian\u2013Laird method to calculate overall prevalence of HIV infection, risk behaviors, and contextual factors for transwomen, transmen, and race/ethnicity subgroups. Main Results. We reviewed 88 studies, the majority of which were cross-sectional surveys. Overall laboratory-confirmed estimated prevalence of HIV infection was 9.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.0%, 13.7%; \u03ba = 24). Among transwomen and transmen, HIV infection prevalence estimates were 14.1% (95% CI = 8.7%, 22.2%; \u03ba = 13) and 3.2% (95% CI = 1.4%, 7.1%; \u03ba = 8), respectively. Self-reported HIV infection was 16.1% (95% CI = 12.0%, 21.2%; \u03ba = 44), 21.0% (95% CI = 15.9%, 27.2%; \u03ba = 30), and 1.2% (95% CI = 0.4%, 3.1%; \u03ba = 7) for overall, transwomen, and transmen, respectively. HIV infection estimates were highest among Blacks (44.2%; 95% CI = 23.2%, 67.5%; \u03ba = 4). Overall, participation in sex work was 31.0% (95% CI = 23.9%, 39.0%; \u03ba = 39). Transwomen (37.9%; 95% CI = 29.0%, 47.7%; \u03ba = 29) reported higher participation in sex work than transmen (13.1%; 95% CI = 6.6%, 24.3%; \u03ba = 10; P = .001). Most outcomes indicated high heterogeneity in the overall and subgroup analyses. Conclusions. The availability of more data allowed us to calculate estimates separately for transwomen and transmen. HIV prevalence estimates for US transwomen were lower than previous estimates, but estimates for HIV prevalence and participation in sex work were higher when compared with transmen. Evidence gaps remain for transmen and the syndemic relationship of HIV, risky behaviors, and contextual factors specific to the transgender experience. Public Health Implications. This study highlights gender disparities for HIV and risky sexual behavior, as well as evidence gaps that exist for transmen.

And what does the prospect of connection imply for our practice as socially engaged, somewhat ethical scholars, therapists, and human beings?}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Endocrinology\", \"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism\", \"Internal Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [109, 0, 1116], "string": "title={The experience with the use of insulin pump therapy in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus}, container_title={}, abstract={Aim.

The study included 36 patients aged 5-18 years with DM1. Efficiency of insulin pump therapy was assessed from the resultsof clinical and metabolic monitoring; the data obtained were treated with the use of the Statistica 6.0 program. Results. The use of insulin pump therapy permits to achieve compensation of carbohydrate metabolism in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetesby modeling therapeutic schemes for individual patients. The basal regime of insulin administration at a minimal rate is indicated to young childrentaking into account their generally low background requirement for insulin. Adolescents need a stepwise regime of insulin delivery with an increasedrate of administration inearly morning and evening hours. Conclusion. The continuous regime of subcutaneous insulinadministration ensures the freedom of choice of the character of physical activity and simplifiescontrol of diabetes in children and adolescents engaged in sports activities.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Electrical and Electronic Engineering\", \"Hardware and Architecture\", \"Software\", \"Electrical and Electronic Engineering\", \"Hardware and Architecture\", \"Software\"]", "language": "en", "length": [48, 0, 0], "string": "title={Extending OPMISR beyond 10\u00d7 scan test efficiency}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes\", \"Mechanical Engineering\", \"Water Science and Technology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [101, 39, 1341], "string": "title={Developing an index model for flood risk assessment in the western coastal region of Mazandaran, Iran}, container_title={Journal of Hydrology and Hydromechanics}, abstract={Abstract This paper represents an index model developed for the assessment of risk caused by river floods. The main purpose of this model is to evaluate the flood risk in the western coastal region of Mazandaran Province/Iran. The model assesses the risk at triple components, i.e. the flood occurrence probability, vulnerability and consequences, through identification and evaluation of effective criteria categorized into seven indexes (environmental, technical, economic, social, depth, population and sensitivity ones) that are involved in all stages of flooding (source, pathway and receptor). The flood risk in the developed model is defined by a dimensionless magnitude called as risk score between 0 and 100 for each zone of the area under assessment by calculating and combining of two newly defined factors: occurrence and vulnerability factor and impact factor. The model was applied in a case study, the Nowshahr flood in 2012. The results showed that: (i) the flood risk zoning was compared with observed data for aspect of the damages, and general agreement between them was obtained; (ii) for urban zones, which surrounded by two rivers, would easily be in critical condition and rescue operations face difficulties; and (iii) it is necessary to review the location of the emergency services, according the flood risk zoning.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Colloid and Surface Chemistry\", \"Biochemistry\", \"Catalysis\"]", "language": "en", "length": [166, 0, 0], "string": "title={Organometallic chemistry of the carbon-nitrogen double bond. 1.

second transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB). Materials and Methods: Of the 75 bladder cancer patients who underwent a second TURB from 2013 to 2015, 23 patients who underwent multi-sequence bladder MRI after their initial TURB were retrospectively evaluated. Thirty lesions were histologically examined at the second TURB and the results of them were compared with the findings obtained through T2-weighted MRI, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), and DW-MRI. Results: Positive findings of 27, 28, and 15 lesions showed up on T2W-, DCE-, and DW-MRI, respectively. Thirteen lesions were confirmed histologically to constitute residual cancer. The sensitivity/specificity/accuracy of T2W-, DCE-, and DW-MRI were 100/18/53, 100/12/50, and 92/82/87%, respectively. DW-MRI was significantly superior in specificity and accuracy to T2W- (p p Conclusions: This study first showed the superiority of DW-MRI to T2W- and DCE-MRI in differentiating residual cancer before

This study examines the quantity of the frequency of fruit tree species, distribution amongst fruit traits and estimates the potential availability of the fruit resource for frugivores in a 16-ha permanent forest plot at Doi Suthep\u2013Pui, Thailand. The similarity amongst traits for fleshy fruited species was explored using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Fleshy fruited species comprised 122 of 208 tree species >2 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) recorded in the permanent plot. Amongst fleshy fruited species, small fruits (length Litsea martabanica and Persea gamblei are the greatest density and represented the major PCA group; black, small-sized and thin husk indehiscent fruits.

Furthermore, large-fruited species such as Madhuca floribunda is low density but important to preserve for food resource of large frugivores.

The association between cancer and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, particularly dermatomyositis, which is termed cancer-associated myositis (CAM), has been reported in the medical literature. A newly described autoantibody to a 155-kDa nuclear protein, identified as transcription intermediary factor 1-gamma (TIF1-\u03b3), has proven useful for cancer screening in patients with dermatomyositis. Material and methods: Based on our database of laboratory results, between November 2014 and January 2016, we found 80 patients with a positive autoimmune inflammatory myopathy immunoblot profile. Results: Eleven of 80 patients revealed the presence of anti-TIF1-\u03b3 antibodies: 8 women and 3 men with average age 54.2 years. Dermatomyositis (DM) was diagnosed in 6 cases, polymyositis in 1 case, myositis limited to ocular muscles and rhabdomyolysis in 1 case each, and undifferentiated connective tissue disease in 2 cases. Neoplasm was found in 4 cases. All of those patients had DM. The average time between DM and diagnosis of neoplasm was 7.5 months (from 1 to 18 months). Conclusions: The association between cancer and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, particularly DM, is well known, and cancer screening should be obligatory in such patients. So far there is no consensus as to the method or frequency with which patients with an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy should be tested to rule out neoplasm. Detection of anti-TIF1-\u03b3 antibodies in patients with DM gives the clinicians the very important suggestion of CAM. It seems reasonable that these patients should have more detailed and often repeated differential diagnostics.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Education\"]", "language": "en", "length": [104, 0, 1695], "string": "title={Practical and Pedagogical Aspects of Learning Through Participation: the LTP Assessment Design Framework}, container_title={}, abstract={Assessment of student learning in experience-based education is recognised as being a complex but important task. Practitioners are faced with a myriad of practical and pedagogical issues that influence what and how they assess, and can severely impact the effectiveness of assessment strategies. This paper presents a synthesised overview of the literature about assessment of student learning that is usually discussed in dispersed arenas and under different headings, such as work-integrated learning, cooperative education, practicum, project-based learning and service-learning etc. The term Learning through Participation (LTP) is introduced to cover all of these areas, but especially those where students undertake experiences and placements that incorporate community engagement and which are based within the curriculum. The literature in this area highlights a number of issues that add layers to the complexity of assessment of LTP. The synthesis presented herein discusses questions of validity, objective verification of learning, the roles and expectations of various stakeholders in the process of assessment, and the role and purpose of reflection in learning and assessment. To assist practitioners a LTP Assessment Design Framework has been created, which guides academics though a consideration and analysis of the practical and pedagogical context of LTP and some of the most important issues. The framework consists of two parts. The first part involves the development of a Placement Profile, to better understand the operational conditions for which the assessment package must be designed, and the second part is a set of

These results suggest possibility of Mn0.7Zn0.3Fe2O4as a high frequency device material.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Anthropology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [120, 0, 883], "string": "title={ET ANTROPOLOGISK BLIK P\u00c5 PSYKIATRISK SYGDOMSOPFATTELSE: Sociale og kulturelle aspekter af en sygdomsmodel for skizofreni}, container_title={}, abstract={This article is about the cultural perception of schizophrenia among psychiatric staff in Denmark.

In this paper, we describe the formation of a community-academic partnership in a federally qualified health center, with the goal of improving the health of young Black men in Detroit, Michigan. After conducting a needs assessment, we built upon existing networks to form a Community Advisory Board (CAB). We held three community forums during which CAB members highlighted key health issues in their community and described how they could be addressed. We developed a plan for future research and community engagement based on community input. Finally, we provide insights on community engagement strategies, forum structure, setting boundaries, trust-building, and valuable information in addressing the inequities in health that affect young

anammox biomass for nitrogen removal from vegetable tannery wastewater}, container_title={}, abstract={AbstractIn the present study, the potential inhibitory effect of biologically pre-treated vegetable tannery wastewater (TW) on anammox granular biomass was evaluated. Beside high organic and chemicals load, vegetable TW are characterised by high salinity and high tannins concentration, the latter belonging to a group of bio-refractory organic compounds, potentially inhibitory for several bacterial species. Recalcitrant tannin-related organic matters and salinity were selected as the two potential inhibitory factors and studied either for their separate and combined effect. Parallel batch tests were performed, with biomass acclimated and non-acclimated to salinity, testing three different conditions: non-saline control test with non-acclimated biomass (CT); saline control test with acclimated biomass (SCT); vegetable tannery wastewater test with acclimated biomass (TWT). Compared with non-saline CT, the specific anammox activity in tests SCT and TWT showed a reduction of 28 and 14%, respectively, suggesting that salinity, at conductivity values of 10 mS/cm (at 25 \u00b0C), was the main impacting parameter. As a general conclusion, the study reveals that there is no technical limitation for the application of the anammox process to vegetable TW, but preliminary biomass acclimation as well as regular biomass activity monitoring is recommended in case of long-term applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work assessing the impact of vegetable TW on anammox biomass.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Polymers and Plastics\", \"Materials Chemistry\", \"Organic Chemistry\"]", "language": "en", "length": [107, 7, 0], "string": "title={Effect of thermal history during drying and curing process on the chain orientation of rod-shaped polyimide}, container_title={Polymer}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Plant Science\", \"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics\", \"Microbiology (medical)\"]", "language": "en", "length": [95, 16, 1760], "string": "title={Consensus for the Treatment of Tinea Pedis: A Systematic Review of Randomised Controlled Trials}, container_title={Journal of Fungi}, abstract={Objective: To systematically review literature enabling the comparison of the efficacy of pharmaceutical treatments for tinea pedis in adults. Design: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with mycological cure as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes did include the clinical assessment of resolving infection or symptoms, duration of treatment, adverse events, adherence, and recurrence. Eligibility Criteria: Study participants suffering from only tinea pedis that were treated with a pharmaceutical treatment. The study must have been conducted using an RCT study design and recording age of the participant > 16 years of age. Results: A total of seven studies met the inclusion criteria, involving 1042 participants. The likelihood of resolution in study participants treated with terbinafine was RR 3.9 (95% CI: 2.0\u20137.8) times those with a placebo. Similarly, the allylamine butenafine was effective by RR 5.3 (95% CI: 1.4\u201319.6) compared to a placebo. Butenafine was similarly efficacious to terbinafine RR 1.3 (95% CI: 0.4\u20134.4). Terbinafine was marginally more efficacious than itraconazole, RR 1.3 (95% CI: 1.1\u20131.5). Summary/Conclusion: Topical terbinafine and butenafine treatments of tinea pedis were more efficacious than placebo. Tableted terbinafine and itraconazole administered orally were efficacious in the drug treatment of tinea pedis fungal infection. We are concerned about how few studies were available that reported the baseline characteristics for each treatment arm and that did not suffer greater than 20% loss to follow-up. We would like to see improved reporting of clinical trials in academic literature.

Practice varies with legislation in different countries. In Norway, crucial decisions such as withdrawing treatment are made by clinicians, usually morally justified to relatives with reference to the principle of non-maleficence. The relatives should, however, be consulted about whether they know what the patient would have wished in the situation. Research objectives: To examine and describe relatives\u2019 experiences of responsibility in the intensive care unit decision-making process. Research design: A secondary analysis of interviews with bereaved relatives of intensive care unit patients was performed, using a narrative analytical approach. Participants and research context: In all, 27 relatives of 21 deceased intensive care unit patients were interviewed about their experiences from the end-of-life decision-making process. Most interviews took place in the participants\u2019 homes, 3\u201312 months after the patient\u2019s death. Ethical considerations: Based on informed consent, the study was approved by the Data Protection Official of the Norwegian Social Science Data Services and by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics. Findings: The results show that intensive care unit relatives experienced a sense of responsibility in the decision-making process, independently of clinicians\u2019 intention of sparing them. Some found this troublesome. Three different variants of participation were revealed, ranging from paternalism to a more active role for relatives. Discussion: For the study participants, the sense of responsibility reflects the fact that ethics and responsibility are grounded in the individual\u2019s relationship to other people.

It shows how Lucarelli confronts the troubling adherence to Fascism through a novel in which investigations are continually hampered by overpowering political forces. By contrast, in spite of expressing an anti-Fascist view, De Giovanni\u2019s novel ends up providing a sanitized version of the Ventennio that allows the protagonist to fulfil his role as a policeman without outward contradictions. By mixing crime fiction and history, Lucarelli intervenes in the revisionist debate of the 1980s and 1990s by attacking the new mythology of the innocent Fascist. Twenty years later, following years of Berlusconi\u2019s propaganda, De Giovanni waters down the hybridization of crime fiction and history with the insertion of romance and the supernatural in order to provide entertaining stories and attract a large audience. In the final analysis, from being functional to political and social criticism in Lucarelli\u2019s series, the fruitful hybridization of crime fiction and history has turned into a mirror of the political and historical de-awareness of Italian society of the 2000s in De Giovanni\u2019s series.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Emerging research suggests that the perioperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) ratio is a prognostic factor for CRC patients. We aimed to determine the association between tumor location, perioperative CEA ratio, and 5-year survival among patients with CRC. Methods: We analyzed 111 patients who underwent resection for CRC at KUMC. After excluding patients without pre- or post-operative CEA data, 62 patients for whom we could calculate a CEA ratio (post-op/pre-op CEA) were classified as either high ( \u2265 0.5) or low (}",

binding motif cause a growth-restricted condition called IMAGe syndrome. We report on a boy with a remarkable mixture of both syndromes, with developmental delay and microcephaly as additional features.MethodsWhole-exome DNA sequencing and ultra-deep RNA sequencing of leucocyte-derived and fibroblast-derived mRNA were performed in the family.ResultsWe found a maternally inherited variant in the IMAGe hotspot region: NM_000076.2(CDKN1C) c.822_826delinsGAGCTG. The asymptomatic mother had inherited this variant from her mosaic father with mild BWS features. This delins caused tissue-specific frameshifting resulting in at least three novel mRNA transcripts in the boy. First, a splice product causing CDKN1C truncation was the likely cause of BWS. Second, an alternative splice product in fibroblasts encoded IMAGe-associated amino acid substitutions. Third, we speculate that developmental delay is caused by a change in the alternative CDKN1C-201 (ENST00000380725.1) transcript, encoding a novel isoform we call D (UniProtKB: A6NK88). Isoform D is distinguished from isoforms A and B by alternative splicing within exon 1 that changes the reading frame of the last coding exon. Remarkably, this delins changed the reading frame back to the isoform A/B type, resulting in a hybrid D\u2013A/B isoform.ConclusionThree different cell-type-dependent RNA products can explain the co-occurrence of both BWS and IMAGe features in the boy. Possibly, brain expression of hybrid isoform D\u2013A/B is the cause of developmental delay and microcephaly, a phenotypic feature not previously reported in CDKN1C patients.}", "multi_hot_encoding":

With the above-mentioned operators as the shift operators on the position space, we introduce a discrete-time quantum walk model on a general hypercube and obtain an explicit formula for calculating its probability distribution at any time. We also establish two limit theorems showing that the averaged probability distribution of the walk even converges to the uniform probability distribution. Finally, we show that the walk produces the uniform measure as its stationary measure on the hypercube provided its initial state satisfies some mild conditions.

This study aimed to show that TR oligomeric state influences binding and dissociation kinetics. We performed binding assays using marked hormone (125I-T3) and TRs expressed and purified by different methods. We find that T3 associates with TRs with biphasic kinetics in solution; a rapid step (half-life \u00b10.1 h) followed by a slower second step (half-life \u00b15 h) and that purification of monomers suggests that biphasic kinetics are due to the presence of monomers and dimers in our preparations. In support of this idea, incubation of TR ligand binding domain monomers with corepressor peptide induces dimer formation and decreases association rates and T3 binds to, and dissociates from, a TR\u03b2 mutant that only forms dimers (TR\u03b2D355R) with slow single-phase kinetics. In addition, heterodimer formation with retinoid X receptors also influences ligand binding kinetics. Together, these results suggest that the dimer/heterodimer surface is allosterically coupled to the hormone binding pocket and that different interactions at this surface exert different effects on ligand binding that may be relevant for TR actions in the cell.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0,

The dynamic response of the compass is examined in detail and its accuracy as a north-seeking device is assessed. It it shown that small amounts of mistuning will result in gross errors. The need for precision tuning is eliminated by supporting the gyroscope on a single-degree-of-freedom platform. It is shown that if the platform is driven via feedback of the gyrorotor displacement in azimuth then the response of the combined system is essentially that of the ideal gyroscope. The overall system is insensitive to misturning errors and will automatically align the gyrospin axis with true north irrespective of any initial offset. The effects of damping, mass unbalance, and platform misalignment are assessed.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

This has created a need for a framework to easily identify what projects can be used for specific applications and how close the tool is to routine autonomous or on-demand implementation and operation. We propose the Application Usability Level (AUL) framework and publicizing AULs to help the community quantify the progress of successful applications, metrics, and validation efforts. This framework will also aid the scientific community by supplying the type of information needed to build off of previously published work and publicizing the applications and requirements needed by the user communities. In this paper, we define the AUL framework, outline the milestones required for progression to higher AULs, and provide example projects utilizing the AUL framework.

with private caches}, container_title={}, abstract={Chip Multiprocessors (CMP) with distributed L2 caches suffer from a cache fragmentation problem; some caches may be overutilized while others may be underutilized. To avoid such fragmentation, researchers have proposed capacity sharing mechanisms where applications that need additional cache space can place their victim blocks in remote caches. However, we found that only allowing victim blocks to be placed on remote caches tends to cause a high number of remote cache hits relative to local cache hits. In this article, we show that many of the remote cache hits can be converted into local cache hits if we allow newly fetched blocks to be selectively placed directly in a remote cache, rather than in the local cache. To demonstrate this, we use future trace information to estimate the near-upperbound performance that can be gained from combined placement and replacement decisions in capacity sharing. Motivated by encouraging experimental results, we design a simple, predictor-based, scheme called Adaptive Placement Policy (APP) that learns from past cache behavior to make a better decision on whether to place a newly fetched block in the local or remote cache.

abstract={Abstract An engineering analysis of the performance of the Block VI Ranger zone water flood operation from its inception in July, 1956, to date is presented. Implications of this performance with respect to future potential of a full-scale project are interpreted. Details are given of the expansion program currently underway, together with a description of the cooperative plan of operation in effect with offset operators. The dual purpose to be accomplished in the flood is explained. The objectives are to effect an economic waterflood operation and to control subsidence of the overlying area through control of reservoir pressure. Reservoir engineering and mechanical problems connected with the operation are treated. Introduction The first waterflooding Operations in the Ranger zone of Wilmington field, Los Angeles County, Calif., were initiated in July, 1956, as a pilot operation on the Producing Properties, Inc., N\u20131 and S\u20131 leases in Fault Block VI. The project is situated near the most easterly extension of the field and in the region where the Ranger zone underlies the downtown area of the city of Long Beach. The N\u20131 and S\u20131 leases of Producing Properties, Inc. are communitized leases comprising approximately 346 acres of town-lot development. Because the drilling of oil wells is prohibited by city ordinance within the area of these leases, the development drilling was accomplished from drill sites located on the west berm of the Los Angeles County flood control channel. This strip, which is located approximately 1,400-ft west of the western limit of Fault Block VI, is 26-ft wide and 5,570-ft long. As will be seen later, the fact that all wells producing from the properties are slant holes drilled from the western drill site has created unique problems in waterflood planning and in interpretation of the results observed in the pilot operations to date. At the time pilot operations were commenced, a total of 65 producing wells existed on the two leases in Fault Block VI; cumulative production had reached 8,889,773 bbl of oil, 12,191,422 Mcf of gas and 398,214 bbl of water. The Parcel A properties of the city of Long Beach. operated by Richfield Oil Corp. and bordering the pilot area to the south, had reached a development of 20 wells and had produced 2,348,465 bbl of oil, 3,764,623 Mcf of gas and 79,607 bbl of water. Development drilling in Fault Block VI of the Ranger zone stops at Pine Avenue in the city of Long Beach, or at its linear projection. The oil-productive Ranger zone unquestionably extends to the east in substantial development beyond this arbitrary boundary. The pilot area is offset to the north by the E. C. Simmons N\u20133 lease which had two producing wells and had produced 141,315 bbl of oil, 218,046 Mcf of gas and 11,531 bbl of water. Thus, at the commencement of the pilot operation. cumulative production from the Fault Block VI Ranger zone had been 11,379,553 bbl of oil, 16,174,091 Mcf of gas and 489,352 bbl of water.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Museology\", \"Archeology\", \"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)\", \"History\"]", "language": "en", "length": [243, 0, 0], "string": "title={Aboriginal Cultural Development in Latin America: An Interpretative Review.

Renin-angiotensin system modulators exert beneficial effects on the diabetic kidney. We explored the action of losartan on AKT-mTOR phosphorylation in glomeruli and podocytes. Diabetes mellitus was induced to Sprague-Dawley rats by streptozotocin. Five months later, the rats were commenced on losartan and euthanized 2 months later. Kidneys were processed for immunofluorescence studies. Glomeruli were isolated for Western blot analysis. Diabetes increased activated forms of AKT and mTOR both in glomeruli and podocytes. In diabetic rats, losartan decreased phosphorylated/activated forms of AKT (Thr308) and mTOR (Ser2448) in glomeruli but decreased only activated mTOR in podocytes. However, in both glomeruli and podocytes of healthy animals, an inverse pattern was evident. In conclusion, a new body of evidence indicates the differential activation of AKT-mTOR in glomeruli and podocytes of healthy and diabetic animals in response to losartan.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0,

active participation of skeletal muscles is a unique characteristic of exertional heat stroke. Nevertheless, the only well-documented link between skeletal muscle activities and exertional heat stroke pathophysiology is the extensive muscle damage (e. g., rhabdomyolysis) and subsequent leakage of intramuscular content into the circulation of exertional heat stroke victims. Here, we will present and discuss rarely explored roles of skeletal muscles in the context of exertional heat stroke pathophysiology and recovery. This includes an overview of heat production that contributes to severe hyperthermia and the synthesis and secretion of bioactive molecules, such as cytokines, chemokines and acute phase proteins. These molecules can alter the overall inflammatory status from pro- to anti-inflammatory, affecting other organ systems and influencing recovery. The activation of innate immunity can determine whether a victim is ready to return to physical activity or experiences a prolonged convalescence.

are becoming nowadays an attractive alternative to classical selective recognition methods due to the \u201cfingerprinting\u201d possibility allowing identifying various analytes without the need to fabricate highly selective binding recognition sites. This work shows for the first time that surfactant-based ion-sensitive microspheres as optodes in the microscale can be designed as cross-sensitive materials; thus, they are perfect candidates as sensing elements for differential sensing. Four types of the newly developed chemosensory microspheres\u2014anion- and cation-selective, sensitive toward amine- and hydroxyl moiety\u2014exhibited a wide range of linear response (two to five orders of magnitude) in absorbance and/or fluorescence mode, great time stability (at least 2 months), as well as good fabrication repeatability. The array of four types of chemosensitive microspheres was capable of perfect pattern-based identification of eight neurotransmitters: dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), acetylcholine, histamine, taurine, and phenylethylamine. Moreover, it allowed the quantification of neurotransmitters, also in mixtures. Its selectivity toward neurotransmitters was studied using \u03b1- and \u03b2-amino acids (Ala, Asp, Pro, Tyr, taurine) in simulated blood plasma solution. It was revealed that the chemosensory optode set could recognize subtle differences in the chemical structure based on the differential interaction of microspheres with various moieties present in the molecule. The presented method is simple, versatile, and convenient, and it could be adopted to various quantitative and qualitative analytical tasks due to the simple adjusting of microspheres components and measurement conditions.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Management of Technology and Innovation\"]", "language": "en", "length": [7, 0, 0], "string": "title={Foreign}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health\"]", "language": "en", "length": [87, 0, 1873], "string": "title={Burden of peripheral arterial disease in Europe and the United States: a patient survey}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Background The aim of the current study was to quantify the burden of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with respect to health-related quality of life, work productivity and activity impairment, and healthcare resource utilization. Methods Data were obtained from the 2010 EU National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS), which included participants from France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK (5EU, N = 57,805) as well as the 2010 US NHWS (N = 75,000). The NHWS is an annual, cross-sectional, self-administered Internet survey which employs a stratified random sampling frame to match the age and gender characteristics of the NHWS sample with known population statistics. Participants who self-reported a diagnosis of PAD were compared with participants who did not self-report a diagnosis of PAD on health-related quality of life (mental and physical component summary scores and health utilities from the Short Form-12v2), work productivity and activity impairment (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire), and healthcare resource use in terms of the number of physician visits, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations in the past six months through regression modeling adjusting for demographics and health characteristics. Results A total of 743 (1.29%) and 777 (1.04%) participants self-reported a diagnosis of PAD in the 5EU and US, respectively. After adjusting for demographics and health characteristics, patients with PAD reported worse health-related quality of life, as measured by health utilities (5EU: 0.66 vs. 0.70; US: 0.66 vs. 0.72; all p Conclusions These results suggest a significant burden for patients with PAD in both the 5 EU countries and the US with respect to both quality of life and economic outcomes. Improved management of these patients may have profound effects from both patient and societal perspectives.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Genetics\", \"Molecular Biology\"]", "language": "de", "length": [59, 0, 0], "string": "title={Genetische Untersuchungen \u00fcber die Milchleistung beim Rinde}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Pharmacology (medical)\"]", "language": "hu", "length": [0, 0, 0], "string": "title={}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Museology\", \"Archeology\", \"History\"]", "language": "en", "length": [267, 0, 0], "string": "title={A History of the British Army.

For unknown reasons, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may trigger new-onset diabetes. Over the last decade, the incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus has increased and the peak age for being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus is getting younger. This article presents a clinical case of an adolescent female patient with new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosed during hospitalization for symptomatic COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction of naso/oropharyngeal swabs). The patient felt ill suddenly, her condition was rapidly worsening. She was hospitalized with severe acute respiratory tract infection. The blood work of the patient revealed hyperglycemia, hyperstenuria, glycosuria, ketonuria, hypertransferasemia, elevated levels of glycated hemoglobin and decreased levels of C-peptide. The patient has been receiving fluid replacement treatment intravenously, short-acting insulin to correct hyperglycemia followed by symptomatic treatment therapy. The patient responded well to the treatment plan and was discharged from the hospital after 8 days continuing treatment from home. Conclusions. The presented article describes a clinical case of COVID-19 in adolescent female patient with new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus. The patient\u2019s severe condition was caused mainly by dehydration and COVID-19 precipitated ketoacidosis despite having light respiratory symptoms.

Flow separation induced by a distortion generator (DG) is either resolved using large eddy simulation (LES) or modeled using the standard k\u2013\u03c9 model, Spalart\u2013Allmaras (SA) model, etc. The immersed boundary method with smeared geometry (immersed boundary method with smeared geometry (IBMSG)) is employed to represent the effect of the fan and a wide range of test cases is studied by varying the (a) height of the DG and (b) proximity of the fan to the DG. Comparisons are drawn between the LES and the Reynolds-averaged Navier\u2013Stokes (RANS) approaches with/without the fan effect. It is found that in the \u201cabsence of fan,\u201d the discrepancies between RANS and LES are significant within the separation and reattachment region due to the well-known limitations of the standard RANS models. \u201cWith the fan installed,\u201d the deviation between RANS and LES decreases substantially. It becomes minimal when the fan is closest to the DG. It implies that with an installed fan, the inaccuracies of the turbulence model are mitigated by the strong flow acceleration at the casing due to the fan. More precisely, the mass flow redistribution due to the fan has a dominant primary effect on the final predictions and the effect of turbulence model becomes secondary, thereby suggesting that high fidelity eddy resolving simulations provide marginal improvements to the accuracy for the installed cases, particularly for the short intake\u2013fan strategies with fan getting closer to intake lip.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation\", \"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [65, 0, 1245], "string": "title={\u2018Stay home when sick\u2019 advice: implications for sport and exercise}, container_title={}, abstract={The coronavirus pandemic has given everyone in society an education on the harms of spread of respiratory illness.

Hospital report cards are commonly produced using administrative data. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of unmeasured clinical data on the accuracy of hospitals\u2019 report cards. Methods. Monte Carlo simulations were based on both administrative and detailed clinical data for patients hospitalized with an acute myocardial infarction in Ontario, Canada. Data were simulated such that the true performance of each hospital was known. Both clinical and administrative risk scores were randomly generated for each patient. The ability of hospital report cards to correctly identify hospitals that truly had higher than acceptable mortality was compared when both clinical and administrative data were used and when only administrative data were used. By using Monte Carlo simulations, we were able to incrementally increase the divergence between the 2 risk scores. Results. In a wide range of settings, sensitivity and specificity of hospital report cards was only negligibly greater when both administrative and clinical data were used compared to when only administrative data were used. Conclusions. Unmeasured clinical data have at most a minor impact on the accuracy of cardiac hospital report cards.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

SOUTHERN ETHIOPIA}, container_title={}, abstract={Enset (Ensete ventricosum) production is declining, and it faces genetic erosion due to drought, diseases and population pressure. Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) and additional formal survey studies on 315 households were conducted over three consecutive years (1998\u20132000) in the Sidama, Wolaita and Hadiya ethnic regions of southern Ethiopia to assess traditional cultivation methods, analyse the production systems, and evaluate farm-based enset biodiversity. The regions differ in terms of cultural background, resources, farming systems, population density, and agro-ecology. Furthermore, the methods for initiating suckers and the frequency of transplanting vary among the three regions.Diverse enset landraces were identified in the Sidama (52), Wolaita (55) and Hadiya (59) regions. Sidama farmers had the highest number of landraces per farm, 57% and 21% more than found on Wolaita and Hadiya farms respectively. In all three regions, landrace diversity was influenced by household resources, cultural background, population pressure, and agro-ecology. There were significant differences in the average number of enset landraces and livestock between rich and poor households in the three regions. Rich farmers had more land and manure-producing livestock, and they planted more enset landraces than did poor farmers. In all three regions, women proved to be more experienced than men in identifying enset landraces.The number of enset landraces per farm was significantly correlated with other household characteristics for resource-rich Sidama farmers and with the number of livestock and area of farmland for resource-rich Hadiya farmers. This suggests that middle-income or poor farmers concentrate on annual crops, rather than on growing the perennial enset plant. More research is needed to identify, characterize and conserve genetic diversity, and to improve the cultivation practices for enset. The cultural, socio-economic, and gender-associated aspects of enset cultivation need to be assessed to understand the dynamics of enset biodiversity.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
