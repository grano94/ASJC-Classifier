component of future development. The Hawker Area of the central Flinders Ranges, South Australia suffers from a lack of reliable data to help with water resource management and decision making. The present study aimed to delineate and assess groundwater recharge potential (GWRP) zones using an integration between the remote sensing (RS), geographic information system (GIS), and multi-influencing factors (MIF) approaches in the Hawker Area of the Flinders Ranges, South Australia. Many thematic layers such as lithology, drainage density, slope, and lineament density were established in a GIS environment for the purpose of identifying groundwater recharge potential zones. A knowledge base ranking from 1 to 5 was assigned to each individual thematic layer and its categories, depending on each layer\u2019s importance to groundwater recharge potential zones. All of the thematic layers were integrated to create a combined groundwater potential map of the study area using weighting analysis in ArcGIS software. The groundwater potential zones were categorized into three classes, good, moderate, and low. The resulting zones were verified using available water data and showed a relative consistency with the interpretations. The findings of this study indicated that the most effective groundwater potential recharge zones are located where the lineament density is high, the drainage density is low, and the slope is gentle. The least effective areas for groundwater recharge are underlain by shale and siltstone. The results indicated that there were interrelationships between the groundwater recharge potential factors and the general hydrology characteristics scores of the catchment.

This immunity includes responses to surface-exposed antigens on Plasmodium sp.-infected erythrocytes. Some of these parasite-encoded antigens may be diverse and phenotypically variable, and the ability to respond to this diversity and variability is an important component of acquired immunity. Characterizing the relative specificities of antibody responses during the acquisition of immunity and in hyperimmune individuals is thus an important adjunct to vaccine research. This is logistically difficult to do in the field but is relatively easily carried out in animal models. Infections in inbred mice with rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi AS represent a good model for Plasmodium falciparum in humans. This model has been used in the present study in a comparative analysis of cross-reactive and specific immune responses in rodent malaria. CBA/Ca mice were rendered hyperimmune to P. chabaudi chabaudi (AS or CB lines) or Plasmodium berghei (KSP-11 line) by repeated infection with homologous parasites. Serum from P. chabaudi chabaudi AS hyperimmune mice reacted with antigens released from disrupted P. chabaudi chabaudi AS-infected erythrocytes, but P. chabaudi chabaudi CB and P. berghei KSP-11 hyperimmune serum also contained cross-reactive antibodies to these antigens. However, antibody activity directed against antigens exposed at the surfaces of intact P. chabaudi chabaudi -infected erythrocytes was mainly parasite species specific and, to a lesser extent, parasite line specific. Importantly, this response included opsonizing antibodies, which bound to infected erythrocytes, leading to their phagocytosis and destruction by macrophages. The results are discussed in the context of the role that antibodies to both variable and invariant antigens may play in protective immunity in the face of continuous susceptibility to reinfection.}",

C\u00f3rdoba, se evalu\u00f3 t\u00e9cnica y econ\u00f3micamente un modelo de producci\u00f3n proyectado para producir dos toneladas de carne por hect\u00e1rea a\u00f1o. Para el efecto, en una pradera sembrada con pasto estrella ( Cynodon nlemfuensis ) de dos hect\u00e1reas se estableci\u00f3 un sistema rotacional de 4 potreros, manejados con 15 d\u00edas de descanso y 5 de ocupaci\u00f3n con una carga de 7 animales/ hect\u00e1rea, con peso inicial de 131 kilos, suplementados durante la \u00e9poca de lluvias con 0.5 kilos/animal/d\u00eda de semilla de algod\u00f3n y en el per\u00edodo seco con ensilaje de ma\u00edz o de sorgo sudax, balanceado con 0.3% de urea m\u00e1s 1.0 \u00f3 1.5 kilos de semilla de algod\u00f3n con salvado de arroz. La evaluaci\u00f3n tuvo una duraci\u00f3n de 365 d\u00edas (31-05-02 al 31-05-03). Durante la \u00e9poca de lluvias (224 d\u00edas) los animales obtuvieron una ganancia diaria promedia de 0.912 kilos/animal/d\u00eda, mientras que en la \u00e9poca seca (141 d\u00edas) alcanzaron un promedio de 0.567 kilos/animal/d\u00eda, para un promedio diario durante los 365 d\u00edas de 0.777 kilos/animal/d\u00eda. La ganancia promedia diaria por hect\u00e1rea fue de 5.45 kilos lo que result\u00f3 en una ganancia de 1.988 kilos por hect\u00e1rea a\u00f1o, muy pr\u00f3ximo al objetivo planteado. El an\u00e1lisis econ\u00f3mico, incluyendo en el rubro de gastos el alquiler de la tierra y los intereses al capital, arroj\u00f3 una utilidad l\u00edquida por hect\u00e1rea / a\u00f1o de $1.541.176.

For this investigation, we tested the hypothesis that the allelic variant (C267A) of the cholinergic receptor muscarinic 1 (CHRM1) confers susceptibility to AD or is related to its age of onset, in a sample population of 232 AD patients and 169 normal controls. The distribution of the CHRM1 genotypes (p = 0.919) and alleles (p = 0.327) did not differ significantly comparing AD patients and controls, even after stratification according to apolipoprotein E genotype. The onset age was not significantly different comparing the CHRM1 genotype groups.

M\u00e9todos: se realiz\u00f3 un estudio no experimental, anal\u00edtico, de corte transversal en ni\u00f1os y adolescentes de cinco a diecisiete a\u00f1os con obesidad. La muestra se separ\u00f3 en dos grupos, uno con la presencia de enfermedad de h\u00edgado graso no alcoh\u00f3lico (grupo 1) y el otro con h\u00edgado normal (grupo 2), determinado mediante ultrasonograf\u00eda. Se realiz\u00f3 antropometr\u00eda, composici\u00f3n corporal y mediciones de niveles s\u00e9ricos para establecer un perfil bioqu\u00edmico y funcional hep\u00e1tico. Las diferencias entre grupos se analizaron mediante la prueba t de Student, p&lt;0.05. Resultados: se estudiaron un total de 59 participantes de los cuales 54.2% (n=32) fue de sexo femenino y 45.8% (n=27), masculino. La edad promedio de la poblaci\u00f3n estudiada fue de 10.05 \u00b1 2.5 a\u00f1os. El grupo 1 estuvo constituido por un total de 72.9% de pacientes (n=43), y el grupo 2 por 27.1% (n=16). Los hallazgos mostraron alteraciones en los niveles s\u00e9ricos, perfil bioqu\u00edmico y funcionalidad hep\u00e1tica. Las transaminasas e insulina en ayuno fueron significativamente m\u00e1s elevados en los pacientes del grupo 1 que en los del grupo 2 (p&lt;0.05). Tambi\u00e9n se observ\u00f3 mayor resistencia a la insulina (p=0.000) en el grupo 1. Conclusiones: existieron alteraciones en los niveles s\u00e9ricos, perfil bioqu\u00edmico y funcionalidad hep\u00e1tica. El ultrasonido y las pruebas de funcionamiento hep\u00e1tico deben formar parte de la valoraci\u00f3n inicial para la identificaci\u00f3n temprana de esta patolog\u00eda en infantes con obesidad.}",

light extraction efficiency in quantum dot light emitting diodes}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of quantum dot light emitting diodes (QLEDs) needs improvement for more power-efficient devices. One of the main limitations is the low light extraction efficiency (LEE). Generally, only 20% of the light that is generated inside the emissive layer makes its way out of the device into air, with the rest being lost to waveguide and substrate modes and surface plasmon polaritons. Different photonics structures have been previously tested to help extract the light that is trapped inside the device. Here we report a photonics design which is a combination of nanopillars and grating structures for improving the LEE of QLEDs. The effect of changing the nanopillar height, radius and material has been studied. It was found that ZnO nanopillars of 500 nm pitch, 200 nm height and 400 nm width alongside 150 nm width and pitch grating structure can increase the LEE at 460 nm by 50% and at 640 nm by 20%. It was also found that different materials can help extract light at different wavelengths. TiO2 nanopillars increased the extraction efficiency at \u223c590 nm region which was not observed by the other materials. As around 19% of the world\u2019s electricity consumption is due to lighting applications, increasing the LEE can significantly reduce the power consumption.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

pseudocapacitive materials with high pseudocapacitance/electronic conductivity is of great interest for hybrid supercapacitors. Recently, the exfoliation/restacking of manganese and cobalt layered transition metal oxides was proposed. Despite improved electrochemical performance of such Mn-Co composites, their bulk organization (i.e. the scale at which the stacking occurs) and structure (i.e. porosity\u2026) remains to be elucidated so far. To tackle this issue, here, SEM and Auger analysis with a nanoscale resolution, coupled to cross-section preparation is proposed. A good correlation between the restacking method, the nanoscale organization/structure of composites and resulting electrochemical performance is obtained. Importantly, the combination of cross-section with Auger analysis allows revealing the nanoscale stacking of the Mn and Co phases. Also, the porosity of the nano-composites, revealed by the cross-section preparation, is correlated to the speed of the restacking process. A fast flocculation step forms aggregates with a porous bulk structure while a slow flocculation step leads to a dense and closed bulk structure of the aggregates. These results highlight that a better control/understanding of the organization/structure of such nano-composites can lead to further improvement. Overall, the innovative cross-section Auger approach proposed in this study should also benefit to the understanding of other nano-composites.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

This study examined changes in performance and satisfaction with self-identified occupational performance goals during a specialized day treatment admission in children and adolescents with eating disorders. Weight-related outcomes for underweight youth were also examined. Methods. A total of 63 youth participated in the study, with admission and discharge data on ratings of self-identified occupational performance goals (measured with the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure) available for 42 participants. Findings. Significant improvements were found in ratings of satisfaction and performance with self-identified goals over the course of treatment. The program was also effective in supporting weight restoration for underweight youth, with a large effect size observed. Implications. A symptom-focused day treatment program for paediatric eating disorders led to improvements in perceived occupational performance. Collaborating with youth to develop self-identified goals in the context of eating disorders treatment can foster autonomy and potentially improve treatment engagement.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Sociology and Political Science\"]", "language": "en", "length": [102, 0, 0], "string": "title={The History of St. Thomas's Hospital.

Here we combined circular dichroism, fluorescence and imaging methodsin vitroto characterize the interaction of\u03b1S with negatively charged vesicles of DOPS (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine, sodium salt) and DOPG (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1\u2032-rac-glycerol), sodium salt) and the consequences of such interactions on\u03b1S amyloid formation. We found that lipid head-group chemistry modulates\u03b1S interactions and also affects amyloid fiber formation. During the course of the experiments, we made the unexpected discovery that pre-formed\u03b1S oligomers, typically present in a small amount in the\u03b1S starting material, acted as templates for linear growth of anomalous amyloid fibers in the presence of vesicles. At the same time, the remaining\u03b1S monomers were restricted from vesicle-mediated nucleation of amyloid fibers.

We hypothesized that \u03b2-cell OGT overexpression (Rip-cre;OgtOE) would confer protection from streptozotocin (STZ)-induced \u03b2-cell failure and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced diabetes. Female mice are typically resistant from HFD- or STZ-induced diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism are unclear. Here, we uncovered that Rip-cre;OgtOE mice show normal peripheral insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in normal chow but when challenged female transgenic mice alone develop glucose intolerance post 8-weeks of HFD and severe hyperglycemia 1-week post STZ treatment. Surprisingly, male transgenic mice are neither protected nor impaired when compared to controls in both treatments. Molecular interrogation of islets validated efficient overexpression of OGT in both sexes by confirming protein expression of the reporter transgene (GFP). However, significant increase in OGT protein was observed only in islets of female Rip-cre;OgtOE mice, suggesting sex difference in OGT protein regulation. Transcriptome analysis by RNA sequencing shows increased expression levels of genes involved in acute inflammation (Ggt5, Ncf1, Ptgs1, Alox5ap) and immune response via agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis (Glycam1) in islets of female Rip-cre;OgtOE mice, providing a mechanism of susceptibility to STZ and HFD-induced islet failure. Indeed, pancreas analysis shows increased islet infiltrating lymphocytes in female Rip-cre;OgtOE compared to control post 22 weeks of HFD treatment. Together, these data highlight the novel role of OGT in inflammation induced by STZ and HFD in islets and emphasize the importance of OGT dosage and O-GlcNAc cycling in \u03b2-cell survival.

Child care facilities are well known as sites of infectious disease transmission, and California child care facility licensure requirements include annual tuberculosis (TB) screening for on-site adults. In April 2004, we detected an adult with TB living in a private-home family child care center (child care center A). METHODS. We reviewed patient medical records and conducted a contact investigation. The investigation included all persons at the child care center, the workplace and leisure contacts of the adult patient with TB, and the household contacts of secondary case patients. Contact names were obtained through patient interviews. A positive tuberculin skin test result was defined as induration of \u22655 mm. DNA fingerprints of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were analyzed. Outbreak cases were those that had matching DNA fingerprint patterns or were linked epidemiologically, if DNA fingerprint results were not available. RESULTS. Between August 2002 and July 2004, we detected 11 outbreak cases, including 9 (82%) among children (&lt;18 years of age). All 11 outbreak patients lived or were cared for at child care center A. The 9 pediatric TB patients were young (&lt;7 years of age), United States-born children of foreign-born parents, and 4 (44%) had positive cultures for M tuberculosis. Including isolates recovered from the 2 adult patients, all 6 M tuberculosis isolates shared identical, 7-band, DNA fingerprint patterns. The contact investigation identified 3 (33%) of the 9 pediatric cases; 2 (22%) presented with illness and 4 (44%) were detected by primary care providers during routine TB screening. Excluding case subjects, 36 (54%) of 67 named contacts had latent TB infection. CONCLUSIONS. Provider adherence to locally adapted pediatric TB screening recommendations proved critical to outbreak control. TB screening compliance by the child care center and more aggressive source-case investigation by the TB program might have prevented or abated this large pediatric TB outbreak.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Applied Mathematics\", \"Computational Mathematics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [94, 0, 0], "string": "title={Results on Newton methods.

the most intriguing features of quantum mechanics and an important resource for quantum communication. For practical applications, it remains a challenge to protect EPR steering from decoherence due to its intrinsic difference from entanglement. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the distillation of Gaussian EPR steering and entanglement in lossy and noisy environments using measurement-based noiseless linear amplification. Different from entanglement distillation, the extension of steerable region happens in the distillation of EPR steering, besides the enhancement of steerabilities. We demonstrate that the two-way or one-way steerable region is extended after the distillation of EPR steering when the NLA is implemented based on Bob\u2019s or Alice\u2019s measurement results. We also show that the NLA helps to extract the secret key from the insecure region in one-sided device-independent quantum key distribution with EPR steering.

Polymorphisms in the promoter region of the TNF-alpha gene at positions -308 and -863 have been identified. We investigated whether these polymorphisms and circulating TNF-alpha levels were related to bone mineral density and bone area in adolescent girls. DESIGN: Bone mineral density (BMD), bone area (BA), anthropometric characteristics and biochemical analyses were measured in adolescent girls and compared with regard to TNF-alpha genotype. METHODS: Allelic variants of the TNF-alpha gene in 97 girls, aged 16.9+/-1.2 years (mean+/-S.D.), were identified using polymerase chain reaction and the restriction endonucleases NcoI and TaiI. Bone mineral density and bone area of the femoral neck, lumbar spine and total body were measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry.

Evidence is scant on the relative and independent merits of leisure-time (LTPA) versus non-leisure-time (NLTPA) activities and how the PA-mortality link may vary across racial-ethnic-gender groups.Methods:Data were from Health and Retirement Study which began in 1992 collecting data on individuals aged 51\u201361 years who were subsequently surveyed once every 2 years. The current study assessed group-specific effects of LTPA and NLTPA measured in 1992 on mortality that occurred during the 1992\u20132008 follow-up period. Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed to examine the PA-mortality link.Results:Net of a wide range of controls, both LTPA and NLTPA showed a gradient negative relation with mortality. No gender-PA interaction effects were evident. Some interaction effects of PA with race-ethnicity were found but they were weak and inconsistent. The mortality reduction effects of PA seemed robust across racial-ethnic-gender groups.Conclusions:Regardless of personal background, PA is a major health promoting factor and should be encouraged in aging populations.

container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Based on the experimental platform of marine power station, the design of the collection circuit was presented and the electrical parameters such as voltage, current, frequency and phase were collected by taking digital signal processor (DSP) in type of TMS320F2812 as the core controller. As regards the site jamming signal existed in power system, the full-wave differential Fourier algorithm was applied to improve the sampling process. It could completely eliminate the DC component and suppress the aperiodic component, while obtaining the accurate fundamental component. Furthermore, the necessary conditions for establishing an effective monitoring system were provided. Combined with the touch screen in type of WEINVIEW MT8100i, the data monitoring and alarm display of the marine power station were realized. The designed data collection and monitoring system can be continuously and stably operated on the experimental platform, which verifies the feasibility of the design.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Colloid and Surface Chemistry\", \"Biochemistry\", \"Catalysis\"]", "language": "en", "length": [118, 0, 0], "string": "title={Rauwolfia Alkaloids.

Background: A survivorship care plan (SCP) is a detailed cancer care summary and future care plan that is generally given to a patient upon completion of adjuvant treatment for a cancer diagnosis. The initial goals of SCPs were to educate patients and other health care professionals about the treatments received, make them aware about potential long-term effects of therapy, and emphasize recommendations for future cancer screening and care (1). Due to numerous barriers\u2014scheduling, staffing, and lack of awareness\u2014SCPs are not delivered to all eligible patients. To address this unmet need our multidisciplinary breast clinic (MDBC) established an Advanced Practice Professional (APP) Survivorship Clinic. With the acute impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, survivorship referrals decreased. We, therefore, developed and implemented system solutions to address SCP access. Methods: System solutions include partnering with the Cancer Registry to provide the list of patients potentially in need of survivorship visits, partnering with pharmacy to confirm patient eligibility, creating specifically designated telemedicine survivorship visits in our electronic scheduling system, prospectively scheduling persons identified, engagement of APPs across the MDBC, and establishing a single coordinating point. Numbers of SCPs delivered are tracked monthly and patient satisfaction is assessed through data collected Press Ganey surveys. Results: This presentation will share our process interventions and outcomes as they mature. Our early data demonstrate the efficacy of the workflow and appear promising. Conclusion: We anticipate that system-based solutions will provide more patients with SCPs and demonstrate patient satisfaction. Blaes AH, Adamson PC, Foxhall L, Bhatia S.

examines the interaction under LOSC of the powers of international courts and tribunals to order binding provisional measures and the obligation of states to make every effort to enter into provisional arrangements pending the delimitation of a maritime boundary. The importance of provisional measures or arrangements in delimiting maritime boundaries, previous state and judicial practice related to provisional arrangements and measures, and the relevant substantive and procedural rules under LOSC are all explored as a means of explaining how courts and tribunals should exercise their powers of ordering provisional measures when provisional arrangements are required. It is argued here that an international court or tribunal should exercise caution in order to ensure that the procedural mechanism complements, rather than conflicts with, the substantive obligation. To this end, provisional measures entailing recommendations, duties of cooperation and obligations of non-aggravation are to be preferred.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

technology in recent years, due to its great potential to revolutionize life-science solutions. Generic microfabrication processes have been progressively made available to academic laboratories thanks to cost-effective soft-lithography techniques and enabled important progress in applications like lab-on-chip platforms using rapid- prototyping. However, micron-sized features are required in most designs, especially in biomimetic cell culture platforms, imposing elevated costs of production associated with lithography and limiting the use of such devices. In most cases, however, only a small portion of the structures require high-resolution and cost may be decreased. In this work, we present a replica-molding method separating the fabrication steps of low (macro) and high (micro) resolutions and then merging the two scales in a single chip. The method consists of fabricating the largest possible area in inexpensive macromolds using simple techniques such as plastics micromilling, laser microfabrication, or even by shrinking printed polystyrene sheets.

The risk of acquiring a tick-borne infection varies across space and time, so knowledge of the occurrence and prevalence of pathogens in ticks can facilitate disease diagnosis in a specific area and the implementation of mitigation measures and awareness campaigns. Here we identify the occurrence and prevalence of several pathogens in Ixodes ricinus ticks in Wester Ross, Northwest Scotland, a region of high tourism and tick exposure, yet data-poor in terms of tick-borne pathogens. Methods Questing I. ricinus nymphs (n = 2828) were collected from 26 sites in 2018 and 2019 and tested for the presence of tick-borne pathogens using PCR-based methods. Prevalence was compared with other regions of Scotland, England, Wales, and the Netherlands. Results Anaplasma phagocytophilum (4.7% prevalence), Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) (2.2%), Babesia from clade X (0.2%), Rickettsia helvetica (0.04%), and Spiroplasma ixodetis (0.4%) were detected, but no Neoehrlichia mikurensis, Borrelia miyamotoi, or Babesia microti. Typing of A. phagocytophilum using a fragment of the GroEL gene identified the presence of both ecotype I and ecotype II. Genospecies identification of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. revealed B. afzelii (53% of infected nymphs), B. garinii (9%), B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (7%), and B. valaisiana (31%). We found similar prevalence of A. phagocytophilum in Wester Ross as in the Netherlands, but higher than in other parts of Great Britain. We found lower B. burgdorferi s.l. prevalence than in England or the Netherlands, and similar to some other Scottish studies. We found higher prevalence of B. valaisiana and lower prevalence of B. garinii than in other Scottish studies. We found S. ixodetis at much lower prevalence than in the Netherlands, and R. helvetica at much lower prevalence than in England and the Netherlands. Conclusions As far as we know, this is the first description of S. ixodetis in Great Britain. The results are relevant for disease surveillance and management for public and veterinary health. The findings can also aid in designing targeted public health campaigns and in raising awareness among outdoor recreationists and professionals.

This reductionist approach has for example been used to assess the basic limitations of visual attention, visual working memory (VWM) capacity, and the fidelity of visual long-term memory (VLTM). The assessment of these limits is usually made in a pure sense, irrespective of goals, actions, and priors. While it is important to map out the bottlenecks our visual system faces, we focus here on selected examples of how such limitations can be overcome. Recent findings suggest that during more natural tasks, capacity may be higher than reductionist research suggests and that separable systems subserve different actions, such as reaching and looking, which might provide important insights about how pure attentional or memory limitations could be circumvented. We also review evidence suggesting that the closer we get to naturalistic behavior, the more we encounter implicit learning mechanisms that operate \u201cfor free\u201d and \u201con the fly.\u201d These mechanisms provide a surprisingly rich visual experience, which can support capacity-limited systems. We speculate whether natural tasks may yield different estimates of the limitations of VWM, VLTM, and attention, and propose that capacity measurements should also pass the real-world test within naturalistic frameworks. Our review highlights various approaches for this and suggests that our understanding of visual cognition will benefit from incorporating the complexities of real-world cognition in experimental approaches.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health\", \"Health Policy\"]", "language": "en", "length": [58, 0, 1266], "string": "title={Empirical Validation of Risk Screening for Down's Syndrome}, container_title={}, abstract={Objective\u2014 To validate individual risk estimates in antenatal serum screening for Down's syndrome.

Memory}, container_title={}, abstract={Loomis, Klatzky, Avraamides, Lippa and Golledge (2007) suggest that, when it comes to spatial information, verbal description and perceptual experience are nearly functionally equivalent with respect to the cognitive representations they produce. We tested this idea for the case of spatial memory for complex paths. Paths consisted entirely of unit-length segments followed by 90-degree turns, thus assuring that a path could be described with equal precision using either an egocentric verbal description or a virtual self-motion experience. The verbal description was analogous to driving directions (e.g., turn left and go one block, then turn right, etc.) except in three dimensions (allowing rotation followed by up or down movement). Virtual self-motion was depicted as first-person travel through a 3D grid of featureless corridors. Comparison of these two conditions produced a result that may be surprising to some, but nevertheless appears to support the notion of functional equivalence: Virtual self-motion does not produce better path memory than verbal description, when care is taken to present equally precise path information. This result holds for even very complex paths and despite evidence from proximity-based interference that the memory representation of the path is spatial.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Water Science and Technology\", \"Ecology\", \"Aquatic Science\", \"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [86, 53, 0], "string": "title={Reproductive biology ofSqualus acanthiasfrom the east coast, South Island, New Zealand}, container_title={New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cancer Research\", \"Oncology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [103, 0, 1349], "string": "title={Targeting Hypomethylation of DNA to Achieve Cellular Differentiation in Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Considerable progress has been made recently in defining and understanding the diverse members of the group of hematologic disorders now known as the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). New systems of classification, based on the latest cytogenetic methodologies, have generated better prognostic data, and basic research has more closely associated molecular mechanisms with clinical subgroups. The mechanisms underlying most cases of myelodysplasia appear to be an array of chromosomal abnormalities leading to suppression of normal myeloid cell differentiation and dominance of abnormal, immature cells. The process is progressive and is mediated by a variety of cytokines, potential loss of tumor suppressor genes, aberrations in signal transduction pathways, and perhaps immune mechanisms. Hypermethylation of specific DNA sequences has been implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS. Until recently, treatment options have been few, high risk, and mostly ineffective. New discoveries, particularly in the area of stimulating remaining normal myeloid cells to resume growth and differentiation, hold promise for safer treatment regimens and improved outcomes. Among the promising new agents are nucleoside analogues, such as 5-azacytidine and decitabine, which reactivate tumor suppressor gene transcription through effects on DNA methylation.}",

The theory advanced is based on research on the Japanese robot industry. The paper opens with a discussion of the meaning of flexibility in a dynamic economy to expose the social division of labour as the foundation of the creation and evolution of production systems. Production systems are established to obtain the scale and scope economies offered by the independent firms of the social division of labour. The necessity to organize production requires the creation of some type of an internal or external governance structure. The Japanese have developed a social technology that resolves the transaction cost trade-offs confronting North American industry between internal and external governance structures.

Therefore, this device can record comprehensive sleep physiological data, offering several advantages such as ubiquity, long-term monitoring, and wearable convenience. In addition, it can provide the clinical doctor with sufficient information on the patient\u2019s sleeping patterns with individualized treatment. In this study, a three-stage sleep staging method (i.e., comprising sleep/awake detection, sleep-stage detection, and REM-stage detection) based on an accelerometer and heart-rate data is implemented using machine learning (ML) techniques. The ML-based algorithms used here for sleep/awake detection, sleep-stage detection, and REM-stage detection were a Cole\u2013Kripke algorithm, a stepwise clustering algorithm, and a k-means clustering algorithm with predefined criteria, respectively. The sleep staging method was validated in a clinical trial. The results showed a statistically significant difference in the percentage of abnormal REM between the control group (1.6 \u00b1 1.3; n = 18) and the PD group (3.8 \u00b1 5.0; n = 20) (p = 0.04). The percentage of deep sleep stage in our results presented a significant difference between the control group (38.1 \u00b1 24.3; n = 18) and PD group (22.0 \u00b1 15.0, n = 20) (p = 0.011) as well. Further, our results suggested that the smartwatch-based sensor was able to detect the difference of an abnormal REM percentage in the control group (1.6 \u00b1 1.3; n = 18), PD patient with clonazepam (2.0 \u00b1 1.7; n = 10), and without clonazepam (5.7 \u00b1 7.1; n = 10) (p = 0.007). Our results confirmed the effectiveness of our sensor in investigating the sleep stage in PD patients. The sensor also successfully determined the effect of clonazepam on reducing abnormal REM in PD patients. In conclusion, our smartwatch sensor is a convenient and effective tool for sleep quantification analysis in PD patients.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Plant Science\"]", "language": "en", "length": [84, 0, 2151], "string": "title={Plant image identification application demonstrates high accuracy in Northern Europe}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Automated image-based plant identification has experienced rapid development and has been already used in research and nature management. However, there is a need for extensive studies on how accurately automatic plant identification works and which characteristics of observations and study species influence the results. We investigated the accuracy of the Flora Incognita application, a research-based tool for automated plant image identification. Our study was conducted in Estonia, Northern Europe. Photos originated from the Estonian national curated biodiversity observations database, originally without the intention to use them for automated identification (1496 photos, 542 species) were examined. Flora Incognita was also directly tested in field conditions in various habitats, taking images of plant organs as guided by the application (998 observations, 1703 photos, 280 species). Identification accuracy was compared among species characteristics: plant family, growth forms and life forms, habitat type and regional frequency. We also analysed image characteristics (plant organs, background, number of species in focus), and the number of training images that were available for particular species to develop the automated identification algorithm. From database images 79.6 % of species were correctly identified by Flora Incognita; in the field conditions species identification accuracy reached 85.3 %. Overall, the correct genus was found for 89 % and the correct plant family for 95 % of the species. Accuracy varied among different plant families, life forms and growth forms. Rare and common species and species from different habitats were identified with equal accuracy. Images with reproductive organs or with only the target species in focus were identified with greater success. The number of training images per species was positively correlated with the identification success.

The technique is based on identification of surface vorticity and wind speed signatures that exceed certain threshold magnitudes, with vorticity averaged over an appropriate spatial scale. The threshold values applied herein are determined from the precursors of 15 tropical cyclones during the 1999\u20132004 Atlantic Ocean hurricane seasons using research-quality QuikSCAT data. The choice of these thresholds is complicated by the lack of suitable validation data. The combination of GOES and QuikSCAT data is used to track the tropical disturbances that are precursors to the 15 tropical cyclones. This combination of data can be used to test detection but is not as easily used to examine false alarms. Tropical disturbances are found for these cases within a range of 19\u2013101 h before classification as tropical cyclones by the National Hurricane Center. The 15 cases are further subdivided based upon their origination source (i.e., easterly wave, upper-level cutoff low, stagnant frontal zone, etc.). The primary focus centers on the cases associated with tropical waves, because these waves account for the majority of all Atlantic tropical cyclones. The detection technique illustrates the ability to track these tropical disturbances from near the coast of Africa. Analysis of the pretropical cyclone (pre-TC) tracks for these cases depicts stages, related to wind speed and precipitation, in the evolution of a tropical disturbance within an easterly wave to a

In red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), a single oral dose of 100 g kg\u20131 CAB can cause abortions and postnatal cub mortality from at least Day 21 of the 52-day pregnancy. The abortifacient activity of CAB is owing to the suppression of PRL, which is essential for luteotrophic support in some eutherian species. Postnatal cub mortality probably results from a reduction in the development of the mammary ductile system, which is also partially dependant on PRL during pregnancy. This paper investigates the potential risks faced by non-target mammalian species that may consume CAB baits intended for fox control. Baiting with CAB is proposed from 1 August until 1 October each year, to correspond with the time that most vixens are pregnant in south-eastern Australia. Thirty-four endemic mammals in south-eastern Australia (9 eutherians and 25 marsupials) are considered to be potentially bait-consuming (PBC) species. The percentage overlap of pregnancy and birth periods for each PBC species was compared with the duration of the proposed CAB baiting period. Only Antechinus (3 species) and Sminthopsis leucopushave greater than 40% overlap, whereas overlap in endemic rodents ranges from 0% to 22%. Overall, most PBC rodent populations appear to face little risk from CAB baiting, as their period of pregnancy does not overlap significantly with the proposed CAB baiting period. The Antechinus species, Phascogale tapoatafa and Dasyurus maculatus are the only PBC mammals that are seasonally mono-oestrous and are thus probably more susceptible to disruption of breeding compared with polyoestrous species that may breed many times a year. At a baiting density of 8 baits km\u20132, theoretical bait availability for small dasyurids, rodents and peramelids is low. This suggests a low potential for affecting these populations if CAB was indiscriminate in affecting reproductive success in all mammal groups. Presently, studies in a limited range of marsupials suggest that, unlike eutherians, the marsupial corpus luteum is independent of pituitary control and thus suppression of PRL is not likely to cause abortions in marsupials. As yet, CAB has not been shown to be orally active in any PBC species other than rodents and carnivores. Oral doses of CAB given post partum have not been found to affect lactation in Sminthopsis crassicaudata,Trichosurus vulpecula, Macropus eugenii andSetonix brachyurus. Further studies are required in order to assess the potential for high doses of oral CAB to affect pre-partum mammary development and early lactation post partum, especially in peramelids and larger dasyurids. Highly target-specific baiting techniques, may eliminate most PBC species from being exposed to CAB and these are briefly discussed.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

for in situ-controlled methotrexate delivery}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Methotrexate (MTX) is widely used for the treatment of various types of cancer; however, it has drawbacks such as low solubility, lack of selectivity, premature degradation, and side effects. To solve these weaknesses, a hydrogel with the ability to contain and release MTX under physiological conditions without burst release was synthesized. The hydrogel was fabricated with a poly(\u025b-caprolactone)-b-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(\u025b-caprolactone) (PCL\u2013PEG\u2013PCL) triblock copolymer, synthesized by ring-opening polymerization. The characterizations by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry confirmed the copolymer assembly, whereas the molecular weight analysis validated the PCL2000\u2013PEG1000\u2013PCL2000 structure. The copolymer aqueous solution exhibited sol\u2013gel phase transition at 37\u00b0C and injection capacity. The hydrogel supported a load of 1,000 \u03bcg MTX\u00b7mL\u22121, showing a gradual and sustained release profile of the drug for 14 days, with a delivery up to 92% at pH 6.7. The cytotoxicity of the MTX-loaded hydrogel was performed by the methyl thiazole tetrazolium assay, showing a mean inhibitory concentration of 50% of MCF-7 cells (IC50) at 43 \u00b5g MTX\u00b7mL\u22121.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Philosophy\"]", "language": "en", "length": [111, 0, 0], "string": "title={Stewart Shapiro and Geoffrey Hellman, eds.

How Cultural Workers Use Reframing to Achieve Legitimacy in Portfolio Careers}, container_title={Work, Employment and Society}, abstract={This article examines how cultural workers interpret and respond to reputational challenges they encounter when leading portfolio careers. Specifically, the portfolio career model involves the cultivation and signalling of adaptability through broad competencies and diverse portfolios comprised of boundary-spanning work. These practices conflict with standards of artistic legitimacy and highlight specialist-generalist tensions, since they can make workers appear to be \u2018jacks of all trades, masters of none\u2019 \u2013 unskilled, opportunistic dabblers, lacking expertise and artistic integrity. The article draws on 56 interviews with cultural producers working as filmmakers, fashion designers and musicians. Findings show how workers engage in \u2018reframing\u2019 to reinterpret the symbolic meanings attached to their behaviours and, in the process, carve out new positions and standards for legitimacy within their fields. Reframing is structured by field and labour market conditions, but also represents the possibility of change as a form of culture in action.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Cannabis Cravings: Formative Study}, container_title={}, abstract={Background Cannabis misuse in young adults is a major public health concern. An important predictor of continued use is cannabis craving. Due to the time-varying nature of cravings, brief momentary interventions delivered while cravings are elevated may improve the use of strategies to cope with cravings and reduce cannabis use. Objective The goal of this manuscript is to describe a formative study to develop coping strategy messages for use in a subsequent intervention. Methods Young adults (aged 19-25 years; n=20) who reported using cannabis >10 of the past 30 days recruited via social media participated in this formative study. Participants rated an initial set of 15 mindfulness and 15 distraction coping strategies on a scale from 1 to 4 (very low degree to very high degree) for clarity, usefulness, and tone. They also provided comments about the content. Results Participants found the initial distraction messages slightly clearer than mindfulness (mean 3.5, SD 0.4 and mean 3.4, SD 0.4, respectively), both were comparable in tone (mean 3.2, SD 0.5 and mean 3.2, SD 0.4, respectively), and mindfulness messages were more useful than distraction (mean 3.0, SD 0.5 and mean 2.8, SD 0.6, respectively). Of the 30 messages, 29 received a rating of very low or low (3 participants or received a comment suggesting a change. We revised all these messages based on this feedback, and the participants rated the revised messages approximately 2 weeks later. Participants earned US $10 for completing the first and US $20 for the second survey. The ratings improved on usefulness (especially the distraction items) with very little change in clarity and tone. The top 10 messages of each coping type (mindfulness and distraction) were identified by overall average rating (collapsed across all 3 dimensions: all rated >3.0). The final items were comparable in clarity (distraction mean 3.6, SD 0.4; mindfulness mean 3.6, SD 0.4), tone (distraction mean 3.4, SD 0.4; mindfulness mean 3.4, SD 0.4), and usefulness (distraction mean 3.1, SD 0.5; mindfulness mean 3.2, SD 0.5). Conclusions The inclusion of end users in the formative process of developing these messages was valuable and resulted in improvements to the content of the messages. The majority of the messages were changed in some way including the removal of potentially triggering language.

Furthermore, there were decreased numbers of nitrogen-fixing and phosphate-solubilizing bacteria beneficial to plants. The Firmicutes phylum (46.79%) was found abundantly in the soil after burned sugarcane harvest. Paenibacillus (34.20%) and Bacillus (9.19%) were dominant at the genus level.

The interaction between vitamin D deficiency and primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate whether patients with PHPT from Spain and Sweden differed in vitamin D status and PHPT disease activity before and after surgery.Methods. We compared two cohorts of postmenopausal women from Spain(n=126)and Sweden(n=128)that had first-time surgery for sporadic, uniglandular PHPT. Biochemical variables reflecting bone metabolism and disease activity, including levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3(25(OH)D) and bone mineral density, BMD, were measured pre- and one year postoperatively.Results. Median preoperative 25(OH)D levels were lower, and adenoma weight, PTH, and urinary calcium levels were higher in the Spanish cohort. The Spanish patients had higher preoperative levels of PTH (13.5 versus 11.0 pmol/L,P0.001), urinary calcium (7.3 versus 4.1 mmol/L,P0.001), and heavier adenomas (620 versus 500 g,P0.001). The mean increase in BMD was higher in patients from Spain and in patients with vitamin D deficiency one year after surgery.Conclusion. Postmenopasual women with PHPT from Spain had a more advanced disease and lower vitamin 25(OH)D levels.

An observational retrospective study was carried out to analyze changes in albumin levels in hospitalized patients at the \u201cFondazione Policlinico Tor Vergata\u2014PTV\u201d in 2018. The prevalence of preexisting hypoalbuminemia at the time of discharge from hospital was investigated using a sample of 9428 patients. Information was collected from the discharge files recorded in the central informatics system of the hospital. Analysis of albumin levels at admission and at discharge was conducted by classes of albuminemia and then stratified by age. At the time of admission, hypoalbuminemia was found to be present in more than half of the sample, with no sex differences. The serum albumin level tended to decrease with age, with pathologic levels appearing from 50 years and progressive worsening thereafter. The condition of marked and mild hypoalbuminemia was more prevalent in patients over 65 years of age. Our findings suggest that hypoalbuminemia should be considered a dangerous condition in itself and a serious public health problem.

Till recently, epithelial ovarian cancers were thought to arise from the ovarian surface epithelial cells. However, recent studies suggest that the majority of high-grade serous carcinomas (HGSCs) arise from lesions in the fallopian tubes. DNA promoter hypermethylation of certain genes is often an early event in tumorigenesis, and it can be detected in blood and other bodily fluids, making it a feasible biomarker strategy for early detection of tumors. Purpose of study: Therefore, we sought to determine the methylation profile of HGSCs as compared to fallopian tube epithelium. Using the Infinium HumanMethylation 450 Array, that permits to quantitatively assess over 450,000 methylation sites, within and outside of CpG islands and more than 20,000 genes per sample, at single-nucleotide resolution, we have obtained the genome-wide methylation profile of HGSC and fallopian tubal epithelium. We conducted a pilot study by comparing the global methylation status in 12 HGSC tissue samples to 15 fallopian tube epithelium samples. In addition, we compared the methylation profile among long-term survivors (more than 5 years) and short-term survivors (2-3 years) of HGSCs. Results: Our results identified the HIST1H2BB promoter as the most differentially methylated region when comparing HGSC with normal fallopian tube samples. Furthermore, we also found that HIST1H2BB is differentially methylated in HGSC patients with long-term survival when compared to patients with short-term survival. Conclusions: Taken together, these results support the potential use of HIST1H2BB promoter methylation as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for ovarian cancer. Our findings could lead to the development of a biomarker for the diagnosis and/or prognosis of ovarian cancer. An early detection biomarker for ovarian cancer could contribute to the reduction and eventual elimination of ovarian cancer health disparities in the US. Citation Format: Blanca L.

and pressure natriuresis. However, their specific effects on the determinants of glomerular hemodynamics remain incompletely delineated. To investigate the P2XR contributions to altered glomerular hemodynamics in hypertension, the effects of acute blockade of P2X1R, P2X7R, and P2X4R with NF449, A438079, and PSB12054, respectively, were evaluated in ANG II-infused rats (435 ng\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121). P2X1R or P2X7R blockade reduced afferent (6.85 \u00b1 1.05 vs. 2.37 \u00b1 0.20 dyn\u00b7s\u22121\u00b7cm\u22125) and efferent (2.85 \u00b1 0.38 vs. 0.99 \u00b1 0.07 dyn\u00b7s\u22121\u00b7cm\u22125) arteriolar resistances, leading to increases in glomerular plasma flow (75.82 \u00b1 5.58 vs. 206.7 \u00b1 16.38 nl/min), ultrafiltration coefficient (0.0198 \u00b1 0.0024 vs. 0.0512 \u00b1 0.0046 nl\u00b7min\u22121\u00b7mmHg\u22121), and single-nephron glomerular filtration rate (22.73 \u00b1 2.02 vs. 51.56 \u00b1 3.87 nl/min) to near normal values. Blockade of P2X4R did not elicit effects in hypertensive rats. In normotensive sham-operated rats, only the P2X1R antagonist caused an increase plasma flow and single-nephron glomerular filtration rate, whereas the P2X4R antagonist induced glomerular vasoconstriction that was consistent with evidence that P2X4R stimulation increases release of nitric oxide from endothelial cells. Mean arterial pressure remained unchanged in both hypertensive and normotensive groups. Western blot analysis showed overexpression of P2X1R, P2X7R, and P2X4R proteins in hypertensive rats. Whereas it has been generally assumed that the altered glomerular vascular resistances in ANG II hypertension are due to AT1receptor-mediated vasoconstriction, these data indicate a predominant P2X1R and P2X7R control of glomerular hemodynamics in ANG II hypertension.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Sociology and Political Science\"]", "language": "en", "length": [55, 0, 0], "string": "title={Vision and Method in Historical Sociology.Theda Skocpol}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Education\"]", "language": "en", "length": [0, 0, 0], "string": "title={}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Advanced and Specialized Nursing\", \"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine\", \"Neurology (clinical)\"]", "language": "en", "length": [98, 0, 647], "string": "title={Intravenous Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator in a Pregnant Woman With Cardioembolic Stroke}, container_title={}, abstract={Background and Purpose\u2014 Historically, the use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) thrombolysis in pregnancy has been regarded as relatively contraindicated.

costimulatory pathway in primary mixed lymphocyte reaction cultures resulted in profound in vitro secondary hyporesponsiveness and 30-fold or greater protection from graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) lethality. Present studies demonstrate that tolerance induction via costimulatory blockade also results in the generation of a potent immunoregulatory cell that inhibits both naive and primed alloresponses. The immunoregulatory capacity was dependent upon cell-to-cell contact that prevented the full activation of the naive or primed cells. The inhibitory effect of tolerized cells did not preclude the response of naive T cells to nominal protein antigen if antigen was present at high concentration. However, under suboptimal antigen concentration, nonspecific inhibition of responses occurred. The tolerized regulatory cell population maintained a polyclonal T-cell receptor V\u03b2 repertoire that was broader than in control primed cultures. These data, the first to demonstrate that tolerance induction via CD40:CD40L costimulatory blockade results in potent regulatory function, are relevant to bone-marrow and solid-organ transplantation. The generation of potent immunoregulatory capacity during tolerization via CD40:CD40L blockade provides a fail-safe mechanism to control alloreactive T cells that may have escaped tolerization. These potent regulatory cells may be clinically exploitable for the treatment and prevention of GVHD or autoimmunity.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

However, infections\u2014related either due to lymphodepletion or the CAR-T cell therapy itself\u2014can result in severe and potentially life-threatening complications, while side effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) might complicate differential diagnosis. Sixty-seven dosings of CAR-T cells in sixty adult patients with NHL (85%) and ALL (15%) receiving CAR-T cell therapy were assessed for infectious complications. Almost two-thirds of patients (61%) developed fever following lymphodepletion and CAR-T cell dosing. Microbiological or radiological findings were observed in 25% of all cases (bacterial 12%, viral 5%, fungal 8%). Inpatient infections were associated with more lines of therapy and more severe CRS. However, overall serious complications were rare after CAR-T therapy, with one patient dying of infection. Pathogen detection after inpatient stay was infrequent and mostly occurred in the first 90 days after dosing. Infections in CAR-T cell treated patents are common. Fast and suitable identification and treatment are crucial in these heavily pretreated and immunocompromised patients. In most cases infectious complications are manageable. Nonetheless, standardized anti-infective prophylaxis and supportive therapy are mandatory to reduce morbidity and mortality in CAR-T cell therapy.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

fluocinolone acetonide in cosmetics}, container_title={}, abstract={AbstractA rapid and specific method was developed for simultaneous quantification of hydrocortisone 21 acetate (HCA), dexamethasone (DEX), and fluocinolone acetonide (FCA) in whitening cream formulations using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The effect of the composition of the mobile phase, analysis temperature, and detection wavelength was investigated to optimize the separation of studied components. The analytes were finally well separated using ACE Excel 2, C18 AR column having 150 mm length, 3 mm internal diameter, and 2 \u00b5m particle size at 35\u00b0C using methanol with 1% formic acid and double-distilled deionized water in the ratio of 60:40 (v/v), respectively, as the mobile phase in isocratic mode. Ten microliters of sample were injected with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, recovery, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), and robustness were determined to validate the method as per International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. All the analytes were simultaneously separated within 8 min, and observed retention times of HCA, DEX, and FCA were 4.5, 5.5, and 6.9 min, respectively. The proposed method showed good linearity with the correlation coefficient, R2 = 0.999 over the range of 1\u2013150 \u00b5g/mL for all standards. The linear regression equations were y = 12.7x + 118.7 (r = 0.999) for HCA, y = 12.9x + 106.8 (r = 0.999) for DEX, and y = 12.9x + 96.8 (r = 0.999) for FCA. The LOD was 0.25, 0.20, and 0.08 \u00b5g/mL for HCA, FCA, and DEX and LOQ was 2.06, 1.83, and 1.55 \u00b5g/mL for HCA, FCA, and DEX, respectively. The recovery values of HCA, DEX, and FCA ranged from 100.7\u2013101.3, 102.0\u2013102.6, and 100.2\u2013102.0%, respectively, and the relative standard deviation for precision (intra- and interday) was less than 2, which indicated repeatability and reproducibility. The novelty of the method was described by forced degradation experimentation of all analytes in the combined form under acidic, basic, oxidative, and thermal stress. The proposed method was found to be simple, rapid, and reliable for the simultaneous determination of HCA, DEX, and FCA in cosmetics.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

controlling extracellular levels of adenine nucleotides and adenosine. To determine the influence of ischemia-reperfusion injury on ectonucleotidase activity in coronary vascular bed, we compared the metabolic profile of adenine nucleotides during the coronary circulation in pre- and post-ischemic heart. Methods Langendorff-perfused rat hearts were used to assess the intracoronary metabolism of adenine nucleotides. The effects of ischemia on the adenine nucleotide metabolism were examined after 30 min of ischemia and 30 min of reperfusion. Adenine nucleotide metabolites were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Results ATP, ADP and AMP were rapidly metabolized to adenosine and inosine during the coronary circulation. After ischemia, ectonucleotidase activity of the coronary vascular bed was significantly decreased. In addition, the perfusate from the ischemic heart contained a considerable amount of enzymes degrading ATP, AMP and adenosine. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the perfusate from the ischemic heart dominantly contained ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1, and, to a lesser extent, ecto-5\u2019-nucleotidase. The leakage of nucleotide metabolizing enzymes from the coronary vascular bed by ischemia-reperfusion was more remarkable in aged rats, in which post-ischemic cardiac dysfunction was more serious. Conclusion Ectonucleotidases were liberated from the coronary vascular bed by ischemia-reperfusion, resulting in an overall decrease in ectonucleotidase activity in the post-ischemic coronary vascular bed. These results suggest that decreased ectonucleotidase activity by ischemia may exacerbate subsequent reperfusion injury, and that levels of circulating ectonucleotidase may reflect the severity of ischemic vascular injury.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Electrical and Electronic Engineering\", \"Hardware and Architecture\", \"Software\"]", "language": "en", "length": [24, 0, 0], "string": "title={IEEE Semantic Technology}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Oncology\", \"Immunology\", \"Immunology and Allergy\"]", "language": "en", "length": [86, 13, 834], "string": "title={Totality of evidence in the development of ABP 215, an approved bevacizumab biosimilar}, container_title={Immunotherapy}, abstract={ABP 215 (MVASI\u2122) is the first approved biosimilar to Avastin\u00ae (bevacizumab).

The generation of expression vectors regulated under cold conditions can improve the expression of some target proteins that are difficult to express in different expression systems. Main body of the abstract The cspA encodes the major cold-shock protein from Escherichia coli (CspA). The promoter of cspA has been widely used to develop cold shock-inducible expression platforms in E. coli. Moreover, it is often necessary to employ expression systems other than bacteria, particularly when recombinant proteins require complex post-translational modifications. Currently, there are no commercial platforms available for expressing target genes by cold shock in eukaryotic cells. Consequently, genetic elements that respond to cold shock offer the possibility of developing novel cold-inducible expression platforms, particularly suitable for yeasts, and mammalian cells. Conclusions This review covers the importance of the cellular response to low temperatures and the prospective use of cold-sensitive promoters to direct the expression of recombinant proteins. This concept may contribute to renewing interest in applying white technologies to produce recombinant proteins that are difficult to express.

Wir vermuten, dass die Unterdr\u00fcckung von maskulinen Eigenschaften bulimisches Essverhalten hervorruft. Um diese Hypothese zu pr\u00fcfen, wurde die Diskrepanz zwischen der Selbstwahrnehmung von geschlechtstypischen Eigenschaften und dem pers\u00f6nlichen Idealbild bei Jugendlichen im Alter von 13 bis 20 Jahren ermittelt und als Ursache von niedrigem Selbstwertgef\u00fchl und bulimischen Symptomen untersucht. Die Daten wurden in einer anonymen Fragebogenstudie erhoben und mit Strukturgleichungsmodellen analysiert. Mit zunehmendem Alter wurde die Diskrepanz zum Idealbild in Bezug auf maskuline Eigenschaften bei M\u00e4dchen gr\u00f6\u00dfer, w\u00e4hrend die feminine Diskrepanz in beiden Geschlechtsgruppen kleiner wurde.

We know that patients with advanced kidney disease can carry a symptom burden similar to that of advanced cancer. Early intervention with medicines aimed at retarding the rate of renal decline and managing the symptoms associated with CKD can be important in improving patients' quality of life and reducing their symptom burden. Prescribing in this group of patients can be challenging as there are many considerations to take into account due to the impaired renal function.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [138, 54, 0], "string": "title={The Association between Fat-Free Mass and Exercise Test Outcomes in People with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Systematic Review}, container_title={COPD: Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Health Policy\"]", "language": "en", "length": [50, 0, 0], "string": "title={Zimbabwe's Hospital Referral System: Does It Work?}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cancer Research\", \"Oncology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [80, 0, 0], "string": "title={Multidrug resistance-associated protein expression in clinical gastric carcinoma}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Speech and Hearing\", \"Education\"]", "language": "en", "length": [68, 0, 0], "string": "title={Looking for an Explanation for the Low Sign Span.

The results showed an increase in the mechanical availability of the cutting and skidding machines from the implantation stage. The mean time between failures increased from the implantation stage, from 31.59 hours to 37.01 hours in the stabilization stage.

This study investigates the efficiency of black-box models including Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous input (ARIMAX) models for forecasting the rainfall-runoff-sediment process. According to the complex behavior of the rainfall-runoff-sediment time series, they include both linear and nonlinear components; therefore, employing a hybrid model which combines the advantages of both linear and non-linear models improves the accuracy of prediction. In this paper, a hybrid of ARIMAX-ANN model is applied to rainfall-runoff-sediment modeling of a watershed. At the first step of the hybrid modeling, the ARIMAX method is applied to forecast the linear component of the rainfall-runoff process and then in the second step, an ANN model is used to find the non-linear relationship among the residuals of the fitted linear ARIMAX model. Finally, total effective time series of runoff, obtained by the hybrid ARIMAX-ANN model are imposed as input to the proposed ANN model for prediction daily suspended sediment load of the watershed. The proposed model is more appropriate, as it uses the semi-linear relation for prediction of sediment load.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Neurology (clinical)\"]", "language": "en", "length": [49, 0, 1673], "string": "title={A Novel Technique for Transpalatal Hypophysectomy}, container_title={}, abstract={Objective A novel technique is described for transpalatal hypophysectomy as an option for sellar region surgery using a microscope and/or endoscope. Technique A straight submucosal tunnel (approximately 20 mm in diameter; 40\u201350 mm long\u2014half the length required by conventional transsphenoidal hypophysectomy) is dissected in favorable alignment with the main tumor axis, providing a direct view that allows the surgeon to operate on large suprasellar tumors, even in cases of extra-axial expansion. Results In a 25-year period, over 50 patients benefited from this surgery. Macroadenomas devoid of extra-axial expansions were totally excised (76.5%), otherwise, partially (23.5%). Forty-nine patients (98%) were extubated soon after surgery. Mean surgery duration was 3 hour 32 minute, with 2 days 6 hour before free feeding was restored. Postoperative hospitalization under neurosurgical care averaged 6 days 6 hour. Currently, patients undergoing the procedure do not require nasal tampons and can eat soft foods soon after recovery from anesthesia. Although two patients (3.9%) presented with oronasal fistulae postoperatively, no episodes of severe hemorrhage occurred during surgery and there were no cases of liquoric fistulae, visual impairment, panhypopituitarism, or severe syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Conclusion The new surgical approach is safe, effective, and well accepted by patients, who reported low levels of discomfort. Postsurgical complications or sequela are currently rare, but further operations should be performed using more appropriate materials, instruments, and equipment to allow comparisons with other techniques.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

According to Chua (1986), this is mainstream \u201cmarket-based\u201d accounting research. We regress multiple dimensions that capture the quality of financial statements\u2019 audit on a group of board of directors (BoD) characteristics for total observations of 225 firm-year obtained for 45 companies during the period (2014-2018). Specifically, the multidimensional analysis of the response variable, audit quality, includes audit firm\u2019s internationalization, audit fees, auditor tenure, and the number of licensed practitioners at the audit firm. Using multiple linear (Panel Least Squares \u2013 PLS) and logistic regression models, we document empirical evidence that audit quality is positively affected by the independence and size of boards but negatively affected by CEOs duality, while no influence of the board\u2019s expertise on any measures of the audit quality.

precipitation data gathered from satellites including PERSIANN, TRMM-3B42V7, TRMM-3B42RTV7, and CMORPH, over Gorganrood basin, Iran. The data collected from these satellites (2003\u20132007) were then compared with precipitation gauge observations at six stations, namely, Tamar, Ramiyan, Bahlakeh-Dashli, Sadegorgan, Fazel-Abad, and Ghaffar-Haji. To compare these two groups, mean absolute error (MAE), bias, root mean square error (RMSE), and Pearson correlation coefficient criteria were calculated on daily, monthly, and seasonal basis. Furthermore, probability of detection (POD), false alarm ratio (FAR), and critical success index (CSI) were calculated for these datasets. Results indicate that, on a monthly scale, the highest correlation between observed and satellite-gathered data calculated is 0.404 for TRMM-3B42 at Bahlakeh-Dashli station. At a seasonal scale, the highest correlation is calculated for winter data and using PERSIANN data, while for the other seasons, TRMM-3B42 data showed the best correlation with observed data. The high values of RMSE and MAE for winter data showed that the satellites provided poor estimations at this season. The best and the worst values of RMSE for studied satellites belonged to Sadegorgan and Ramiyan stations, respectively.

In response to the need for a centralized resource, NeuroShare, a no-cost website that collects and organizes cross-cultural neuropsychological normative data was created. The purpose of this study was to gather information on the current practices of cross-cultural neuropsychology, the utility of NeuroShare, and potential improvements that could be made to the platform. Participants and Method An anonymous survey was distributed to neuropsychologists and trainees through national and regional professional listservs. Participants\u2019 demographics, clinical experience, and current practices (e.g. use of language specific normative data, assessment of acculturation/bilingualism) when providing neuropsychological services to Spanish-speaking populations were collected. The survey examined feedback on the NeuroShare database. Results 60 participants completed the survey, and they were primarily White/ Caucasian (62%), along with Hispanic/ Latino (36%), Black/African American (1%), and biracial/multiracial (1%). About 66% reported that they often search for Spanish language normative data depending on the patient\u2019s demographics. 70% of respondents reported administering tests developed primarily for English-speaking populations, that are then adapted, when testing Spanish-speaking individuals. Some recommendations for improving Neuroshare included the incorporation of pediatric normative data and a normative data calculator tool. Conclusions This study highlights the needs and benefits of a comprehensive, easy to use system in collecting and organizing normative information for diverse populations. NeuroShare serves as a tool to facilitate the practice of cross-cultural neuropsychology, as well as a catalyst to improve neuropsychological services through the provision of improved access to appropriate normative measures for use with diverse populations.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health\", \"Geriatrics and Gerontology\", \"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)\", \"Social Psychology\", \"Health (social science)\"]", "language": "en", "length": [142, 0, 0], "string": "title={Suzanne K.

We propose approaches to observing and analyzing the collaboration in human\u2013machine teams, developing the concept of operations with relevant stakeholders, and including ethical aspects in the design and development. We base our work on the joint cognitive systems approach and propose complementary approaches and methods, namely: actor\u2013network theory, the concept of operations and ethically aware design.

this area are not so great as originally estimated; moreover, the reserves discovered here annually have not kept pace with requirements, resulting in a critical gas supply shortage. Unless there are better price incentives and more freedom from unpredictable delays caused by regulations, there is little hope for improvement. Introduction The deep Delaware-Val Verde basin is one of the few large basins in the U. S. where exploration has been directed specifically toward development of substantial nonassociated gas reserves. The deep pre-Pennsylvanian reservoirs of this basin are now producing percent of the total U. S. gas requirements. Exploration and development have been complicated by many uncertainties such asunknown price structure,long, unpredictable delays between the time of discovery or development and marketing of the gas, andthe difficulty of determining reserves and profitability with very limited reservoir or production data. production data. Our purpose is to review briefly the history of exploration and development of this area under these handicaps, analyze current trends, estimate recoverable reserves as of Jan. 1, 1970, and discuss econonda and problems facing the industry today. A realistic appraisal of these factors is the basis for decisions now evolving that may affect future development of this basin and thereby affect the present gas supply shortage. A study of drilling activity was conducted by reviewing all of the deep tests in the basin. Reserve estimates were based on a study of all available data on every pre-Pennsylvanian gas well. A statistical analysis of the exploration effort, the reserves and the deliverability was used for economic projections to evaluate the profitability of continued exploration and development under current conditions. History The deep Delaware-Val Verde basin is defined here as the area within the geological boundaries of the Delaware-Val Verde basin where exploration and development drilling activity have been directed toward testing the gas-bearing pre-Pennsylvanian formations at depths ranging from 10,000 to 25,000 ft. The discussion relates primarily to the Ellenburger formation, which contains 75 percent of the reserves. Shallow reserves above the Mississippian have minimal effect on the over-all conclusions and were not included. Fig. 1 shows the general configuration of the Delaware-Val Verde basin and location of the fields, development wells, and wildcat dry holes. The wells indicated by an arrow represent 1970 wildcats completed or drilling as of midyear 1970. The numbers by the fields indicate generally the order of discovery of each reservoir and refer to Table 1, which identifies the reservoirs, showing year of discovery, depth of the reservoir in the discovery well, CO2 content of the gas, cumulative production to Jan. 1, 1970, and number of gas completions in each reservoir. The average depth of the 54 reservoirs listed is 16,000 ft. The exploration of this trend started in earnest after the discovery of the Puckett and Brown Bassett fields in 1952 and 1953. Other important fields discovered were N. E. Oates and Worsham Bayer in 1961, Coyanosa and Gomez in 1963, Grey Ranch and Waha in 1964, J. M. and West Waha in 1965, Lockridge and Toro in 1966, Block 16 and Pikes Peak in 1968 and Barstow and Mi Vida in 1969. All of the fields below 20,000 ft have been found since the discovery of the giant Gomez field in 1963.

The kinematic relationships are developed with emphasis on the effect of the different design parameters on reducing the circulating power inherent in this type of system. The study shows that a compromise has to be made between the number of non-circular gear sets to be used and the circulating power generated in the system. For the illustrative example of a 200 hp (149 kW) system it is shown that, for a gear ratio range from 1 to 4 and the considered characteristic curve on the non-circular gears, four sets of summing differentials are estimated to be required and the maximum instantaneous circulating power at the worst condition would be approximately 6 times the output power. The circulating power changes from its minimum of 1.5 to its maximum value with an average circulating power of 2.8 times the output power.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Civil and Structural Engineering\"]", "language": "en", "length": [80, 37, 485], "string": "title={Design effectiveness of wind tunnel studies for buildings of intermediate height}, container_title={Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering}, abstract={The components of a comprehensive model study involving both meteorological and wind tunnel investigations are discussed.

Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) is associated with severe insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis in non-obese individuals, but there are no data evaluating the presence of sleep disorders in this condition. The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of sleep pattern in individuals with CGL and evaluate the presence of sleep disorders in these patients. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study with 8 patients with CGL. It was performed a polysomnography following the guidelines of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Results: There were 2 male and 6 female patients. The median age of these patients is 16,5 years old, ranging from 7 to 33 years old. All patients have hypertriglyceridemia and 6/8 had diabetes. Hepatic steatosis was observed in 4/8 cases (50%) and systemic arterial hypertension in 1/8 case (12,5%). Snore was observed in 7/8 (87,5%) of the sample. The diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was observed in 6/8 (75%) of the individuals, rapid eye movement sleep (REM) behavior disorder in 4/8 (50%), changes in sleep efficiency in 4/8 (50%), fragmented sleep in 8/8 (100%) and periodic leg movements in 7/8 (87,5%). There were no significant cardiovascular abnormalities in this study. Conclusion: The patients with CGL evaluated showed a high frequency of sleep disorders. These findings in a young no-obese population, but with severe metabolic abnormalities, suggest its negative impact in sleep quality of these patients, increasing the cardiovascular risk in this population.

However, the relative importance of facilitation by tree species after variable retention harvesting is unclear. We used a field experiment to evaluate the effect of two facilitator species, Castanopsis fissa (C. fissa) and Manglietia glauca (M. glauca), managed with variable retention harvesting, on the development of two target species, Castanopsis hystrix (C. hystrix) and Erythrophloeum fordii (E. fordii), in a Masson pine ( Pinus massoniana) monoculture. The following variables were measured for all of the four interplanted tree species: structural growth, regeneration, aboveground biomass accumulation, leaf area index, and soil conditions. The results indicate that the abundance, growth, and aboveground biomass were relatively greater in plots planted with C. fissa compared with M. glauca and that the target species performed best with 50% retention harvesting of C. fissa, with an improved establishment of both target species indicating a positive interaction. In addition, the regeneration, leaf area index and soil conditions differed between the two facilitators in the variable retention harvesting treatments because of the different intrinsic characteristic of the facilitators. In summary, our results imply that managers have considerable flexibility to employ various types of facilitation schemes coupled with different harvesting systems for successful short-term restoration within a monoculture.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Horticulture\", \"Genetics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [75, 0, 888], "string": "title={Performance of Tomato Cultivars After Various Types of Transplant Clipping1}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract The performance of H-1350, H-1409, C-17, \u2018Fireball\u2019, and \u2018Roma\u2019 tomato transplants that received different clipping treatments at Tifton, Georgia, were evaluated at Lafayette, Indiana, and the Plant Industry Station, Beltsville, Maryland.

However, fungal growth, including removal efficiency, can be affected by several factors, such as temperature and the pH. The ability of fungal isolates to grow in the presence of carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and sulfamethoxazole was tested. Removal efficiency results indicated that a fungal isolate of Aspergillus luchuensis can completely (>99.9%) remove diclofenac from a synthetic wastewater media without a pH correction within 10 days of incubation. Furthermore, the results of the biosorption test for A. luchuensis indicate that this isolate uses the biosorption mechanism as a strategy to remove diclofenac. Finally, the results demonstrate that A. luchuensis can remove >98% of diclofenac in non-sterile wastewater without a pH correction immediately after biomass inoculation on biofilm carriers while Trametes versicolor requires an incubation period of at least 24 h to completely remove diclofenac.

Methods The amounts of phenolic compounds were determined by colorimetric assays and identified by high performance and liquid chromatography coupled with ultraviolet detector (HPLC-UV) method. The chemical composition of essential oils was determined by gas-chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method. For the evaluation of the antioxidant activity of essential oils and extracts, two different assays (reducing power and DPPH radical scavenging activity) were used. Results Infusion extract presented the highest phenolic content, followed by the decoction one, while the lowest amount was observed in essential oils. The amount of flavonoids of the decocted extract was higher than that of the infused one. The phenolic profile of C. nepeta infusion and decoction extracts revealed the presence of 28 and 13 peaks, respectively. Four phenolics compounds were identified in infusion (gallic acid (GA), rosmarinic acid (RA), caffeine (C) and caffeic acid (CA)) and two were identified in decoction (GA and RA). The chemical composition of essential oils revealed the presence of 29 compounds, accounting for the 99.7% of the total oils. Major compounds of essential oil (EO) were trans-menthone (50.06%) and pulegone (33.46%). Infusion and decoction extracts revealed an interesting antioxidant activity which correlates positively with their total phenolic contents. Conclusions These results showed that Calamintha nepeta could be considered as a valuable source of phenolics and essential oils with potent antioxidant activity.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Library and Information Sciences\", \"Literature and Literary Theory\", \"Linguistics and Language\", \"Language and Linguistics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [26, 0, 0], "string": "title={Motto to 'Daniel Deronda.'}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Law\"]", "language": "en", "length": [128, 13, 0], "string": "title={Patterns of American Jurisprudence by Neil Duxbury.

One strategy to reduce CRS is subcutaneous dosing, which is hypothesized to mitigate CRS by reducing the maximum drug concentration (Cmax) and preserve efficacy by maintaining the same minimum drug concentration (Cmin) as intravenous dosing. Although promising for mitigating CRS, this approach is limited by its increased immunogenicity risks. A T cell engager designed to be dosed intravenously but engineered to mimic the PK properties of subcutaneous dosing could alleviate CRS without increasing immunogenicity. Here we describe TriTAC-XR, a platform of T cell engager prodrugs designed to become slowly activated in systemic circulation. This extended-release mechanism results in a slow build-up of circulating active drug and minimizes the Cmax/Cmin ratio, similar to subcutaneous dosing. TriTAC-XR prodrugs were engineered by adding a peptide mask and protease-cleavable linker to the N-terminus of a TriTAC, a constitutively active and half-life extended T cell engager. The mask binds to the anti-CD3\u03b5 domain and inhibits T cell binding. Upon cleavage by systemic proteases, active T cell engager is released. In vitro, TriTAC-XR has markedly reduced binding to recombinant CD3\u03b5 protein and to primary T cells as well as reduced potency in functional T cell-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (TDCC) assays compared to its unmasked active drug. In cynomolgus monkeys, TriTAC-XRs targeting multiple tumor antigens resulted in a gradual build-up of active drug during the first week post dose and significantly lower Cmax/Cmin ratios than comparable constitutively active TriTACs. Modeling based on these PK data predicts that TriTAC-XR dosed intravenously will result in a slower build-up of active drug and smaller Cmax/Cmin ratios than TriTAC dosed intravenously or subcutaneously. Cytokine release and target cell depletion in cynomolgus monkeys were used to compare the therapeutic index of TriTAC-XR to TriTAC. A single dose of FLT3-targeting TriTAC-XR resulted in 100-fold protection in cytokine release and similar FLT3 expressing cell depletion when compared to an equivalent FLT3-targeting TriTAC. Similarly, repeat dosing of a TriTAC-XR targeting B cells resulted in complete B cell depletion with substantially lower cytokines than a comparable TriTAC. TriTAC-XR is expected to improve the safety of T cell engagers by reducing CRS and may increase clinical dosing convenience by enabling higher doses that will extend dosing intervals.

Observations of the scale-dependent turbulent fluxes, variances, and the bulk transfer parameterization for sensible heat above, within, and beneath a tall closed Douglas-fir canopy in very weak winds are examined. The daytime sub-canopy vertical velocity spectra exhibit a double-peak structure with peaks at timescales of 0.8 s and 51.2 s. A double-peak structure is also observed in the daytime sub-canopy heat flux co-spectra. The daytime momentum flux co-spectra in the upper bole space and in the sub-canopy are characterized by a relatively large cross-wind component, likely due to the extremely light and variable winds, such that the definition of a mean wind direction, and subsequent partitioning of the momentum flux into along- and cross-wind components, has little physical meaning. Positive values of both momentum flux components in the sub-canopy contribute to upward transfer of momentum, consistent with the observed sub-canopy secondary wind speed maximum. For the smallest resolved scales in the canopy at nighttime, we find increasing vertical velocity variance with decreasing timescale, consistent with very small eddies possibly generated by wake shedding from the canopy elements that transport momentum, but not heat. Unusually large values of the velocity aspect ratio within the canopy were observed, consistent with enhanced suppression of the horizontal wind components compared to the vertical by the very dense canopy. The flux\u2013gradient approach for sensible heat flux is found to be valid for the sub-canopy and above-canopy layers when considered separately in spite of the very small fluxes on the order of a few W m\u22122 in the sub-canopy. However, single-source approaches that ignore the canopy fail because they make the heat flux appear to be counter-gradient when in fact it is aligned with the local temperature gradient in both the sub-canopy and above-canopy layers. While sub-canopy Stanton numbers agreed well with values typically reported in the literature, our estimates for the above-canopy Stanton number were much larger, which likely leads to underestimated modeled sensible heat fluxes above dark warm closed canopies.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Second, in 2005 Japan resumed its new commitments on yen loans, and it would be appropriate to review our ODA policy to Pakistan before our yen loan operation is put back in full swing. Third, Japan\u2019s ODA to Pakistan has mainly been delivered through projects. Facing the growing criticism against the project approach, it would be our responsibility as a major donor to review the effectiveness of our main aid modality.

Conventional wisdom lends itself to two contradictory predictions. On one hand, it is said that conflict with an out-group is the surest path to unity in an in-group. On the other hand, repression exaggerates the gap between radicals and moderates in a movement. Challenging both views, this article argues that repression amplifies trends in cooperation or conflict existent in a movement before the onset of repression. All movements have some institutional arrangement, meaning a set of procedures and relationships that structure decision making and behavior. These \u201crules of the game\u201d distribute power within the movement, and thus favor some actors over others. Repression disrupts the equilibrium of these institutions, after which the members might engage in either more cooperation or more conflict, depending on the level of satisfaction with preexisting institutional arrangements. The authors illustrate these propositions through comparative analysis of four repression shocks from two nationalist movements: the Kurdish movement in Iraq and the Palestinian national movement.}",

Integrating the different sectors and synergizing the tourism system function are major issues as the tourism industry requires different levels of involvement with diverse interests. Since tourism is one of the key areas of economic transformation in developing countries, it is essential to enhance destination image, positioning, and ultimately to achieve market leadership which can contribute significantly to communities and nations. It is important to evaluate the performance of the tourist destination in order to stabilize the growth of tourism in the most competitive and sustainable manner. This study explains the construction of Index Core Components and performance evaluation methods for internal tourist destination benchmarking using literature reviews.

The product design based on Icepak replaces the test on the physical prototype with the simulation on the virtual prototype, We should reduce or even cancel the manufacturing of physical prototype, shorten the R & D process, and cut R & D costs with the improvement of design quality. Through the comparison and analysis with the experimental data of the offline detection platform, the feasibility of using Icepak to simulate the equipment is proved. The software is used to simulate the ther-mal environment in the hot box. Through comparison and analysis, the most uniform upper wi-nd steady-state thermal environment scheme is found.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

These microsomal vesicles demonstrated a low K+ permeability, such that the addition of valinomycin resulted in marked stimulation of (H+ + K+)-ATPase activity, and proton accumulation. When isolated from stimulated parietal cells, the (H+ + K+)-ATPase was redistributed to larger, denser vesicles: stimulation-associated (s.a.) vesicles. S.a. vesicles showed an increased K+ permeability, such that maximal (H+ + K+)-ATPase and proton accumulation activities were observed in low K+ concentrations and no enhancement of activities occurred on the addition of valinomycin. The change in subcellular distribution of (H+ + K+)-ATPase correlated with morphological changes observed with stimulation of parietal cells, the microsomes and s.a. vesicles derived from the intracellular tubulovesicles and the apical plasma membrane, respectively. Total (H+ + K+)-ATPase activity recoverable from stimulated gastric mucosa was 64% of that from resting tissue. Therefore, we tested for latent activity in s.a. vesicles. Permeabilization of s.a. vesicles with octyl glucoside increased (H+ + K+)-ATPase activity by greater than 2-fold. Latent (H+ + K+)-ATPase activity was resistant to highly tryptic conditions (which inactivated all activity in gastric microsomes). About 20% of the non-latent (H+ + K+)-ATPase activity was also resistant to trypsin digestion.

Palm Rachis with Citric Acid}, container_title={}, abstract={The manufacture of technical materials of mineral and synthetic origin currently used for thermal insulation in buildings consumes a large amount of energy and they are not biodegradable. In order to reduce the environmental problems generated by their manufacture, an increasing amount of research is being carried out on the use of renewable and ecological resources. Consequently, the use of plant fibers and natural adhesives in the development of new thermal insulating products is increasing worldwide. Palm trees were used as a replacement for wood in some traditional constructions in places with scarce wood resources. This paper discusses the use of palm pruning waste in the manufacture of particleboards, using citric acid as a natural binder. Five particle sizes of Washingtonia palm rachis were used as the raw material for manufacturing the boards and the citric acid content was set at 10% by weight, in relation to the weight of the rachis particles. Single-layer agglomerated panels were made, applying a pressure of 2.6 MPa and a temperature of 150 \u00b0C for 7 min. Twenty panels were produced and their density, thickness swelling, water absorption, modulus of rupture, internal bonding strength and thermal conductivity properties were studied. Smaller particle size resulted in better mechanical properties. The boards had an average thermal conductivity of 0.084 W/m\u00b7K, meaning that these boards could be used for thermal insulation in buildings.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

However, there are limited targeted therapies that address this disease hallmark. While the invasive capacity of self-renewing cancer stem cells (CSCs) and their non-CSC progeny has been investigated, the mode(s) of migration used by CSCs during invasion is currently unknown. Here we used time-lapse microscopy to evaluate the migratory behavior of CSCs, with a focus on identifying key regulators of migration. A head-to-head migration assay demonstrated that CSCs are more invasive than non-CSCs. Time-lapse live cell imaging further revealed that GBM patient-derived CSC models either migrate in a collective manner or in a single cell fashion. To uncover conserved molecular regulators responsible for collective cell invasion, we utilized the genetically tractable Drosophila border cell collective migration model. Candidates for functional studies were generated using results from a targeted Drosophila genetic screen followed by gene expression analysis of the human homologs in GBM tumors and associated GBM patient prognosis. This strategy identified the highly conserved small GTPase, Rap1a, as a potential regulator of cell invasion. Alteration of Rap1a activity impaired the forward progress of Drosophila border cells during development. Rap1a expression was elevated in GBM and associated with higher tumor grade. Functionally, the levels of activated Rap1a impacted CSC migration speed out of spheres onto extracellular matrix. The data presented here demonstrate that CSCs are more invasive than non-CSCs, are capable of both collective and single cell migration, and express conserved genes that are required for migration and invasion. Using this integrated approach, we identified a new role for Rap1a in the migration of GBM CSCs.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

PRV causes neurological, respiratory, and reproductive disorders, often resulting in mortality of young and immunocompromised animals. Mortality, decreased production, and trade restrictions result in significant financial losses for the agricultural industry. Understanding the molecular mechanisms utilized by PRV to enter host cells is an important step in identifying novel strategies to prevent infection and spread. A thorough understanding of these mechanisms will contribute to a broader understanding of alphaherpesvirus entry.

The gene products, TVN1315 and Ta0286, were identified as archaeal trehalases. These trehalases belong to the CAZy database family GH15, although they have putative (\u03b1/\u03b1) 6 barrel catalytic domain structures similar to those of GH37 and GH65 family trehalases from other organisms. These newly identified trehalases function within a narrow range of acidic pH values (pH 3.2 to 4.0) and at high temperatures (50 to 60\u00b0C), and these enzymes display K m values for trehalose higher than those observed for typical trehalases. These enzymes were inhibited by validamycin A; however, the inhibition constants ( K i ) were higher than those of other trehalases. Three TVN1315 mutants, corresponding to E408Q, E571Q, and E408Q/E571Q mutations, showed reduced activity, suggesting that these two glutamic acid residues are involved in trehalase catalysis in a manner similar to that of glucoamylase. To date, TVN1315 and Ta0286 are the first archaeal trehalases to be identified, and this is the first report of the heterologous expression of GH15 family trehalases. The identification of these trehalases could extend our understanding of the relationships between the structure and function of GH15 family enzymes as well as glycoside hydrolase family enzymes; additionally, these enzymes provide insight into archaeal trehalose metabolism.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0,

Methods A rapid review of the literature from Australia, New Zealand, UK and Canada was undertaken. The review included literature pertaining to the cost-of-illness and impact of mental illness as well as any modelling studies. Included studies were categorised according to impact on education, labour force engagement, earlier retirement or welfare dependency. The well-accepted Drummond 10-point economic appraisal checklist was used to assess the quality of the studies. Results A total of 45 methodologically diverse studies were included. The studies highlight the significant burden mental illness places on all facets of society, including individuals, families, workplaces and the wider economy. Mental illness results in a greater chance of leaving school early, a lower probability of gaining full-time employment and a reduced quality of life. Research from Canada suggests that the total economic costs associated with mental illness will increase six-fold over the next 30 years with costs likely to exceed A$2.8 trillion (based on 2015 Australian dollars). Conclusions Mental illness is associated with a high economic burden. Further research is required to develop a better understanding of the trajectory and burden of mental illness so that resources can be directed towards cost-effective interventions. What is known about the topic? Although mental illness continues to be one of the leading contributors to the burden of disease, there is limited information on the economic impact that mental illness imposes on individuals, families, workplaces and the wider economy. What does this paper add? This review provides a summary of the economic impact and cost of mental illness. The included literature highlights the significant burden mental illness places on individuals, families, workplaces, society and the economy in general. The review identified several areas for improvement. For example, only limited information is available on the impact of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, cognitive function, conduct disorder, eating disorder and psychological distress. There was also a dearth of evidence on the intangible elements of pain and suffering of people and their families with depressive disorders. More research is required to better understand the full extent of the impact of mental illness and strategies that may be implemented to minimise this harm. What are the implications for practitioners? Knowing the current and future impact of mental illness highlights the imperative to develop an effective policy response.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Mechanical Engineering\", \"Energy Engineering and Power Technology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [152, 0, 1271], "string": "title={Effect of adding simultaneous hydrophilic and microporous layers on water transport in the gas diffusion layer of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell}, container_title={}, abstract={In this study, the effect of location, wettability, and thickness of the hydrophilic layer and also the effect of microporous layer (MPL) thickness on the dynamic water transport in the gas diffusion layer (GDL) of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is investigated using the Lattice Boltzmann method. The effect of the presence of hydrophilic layer and MPL on the number of dominant flow paths, liquid water breakthrough sites, liquid water loops, liquid water pools, and time required to reach steady-state for 12 cases have been investigated. Results showed that if the hydrophilic layer is near the MPL/GDL interface, flooding will occur. Also, comparing with purely hydrophobic GDL, reduction of hydrophilic layer thickness in the GDL/GC interface reduces the water saturation level by 11.8% and the time required to reach steady-state by 8.88%. Moreover, this study indicated that adding a thin layer of MPL at the catalyst layer (CL)/GDL interface with present a hydrophilic thin layer at the GDL/gas channel (GC) interface reduces the liquid water saturation level by 50.1% and the steady-state time by 38.9%.

construction project portfolio management}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Background Construction companies typically work on many projects simultaneously each with its own objectives and resource demands. Consequently, a key managerial function is to allocate financial, equipment, and human resources between these concurrent projects in a way that satisfies the individual project constraints while optimizing the company\u2019s overall objectives. Project portfolio management is concerned with managing multiple projects to accomplish strategic goals. The main concentrations of research so far have been project selection, prioritization and alignment of a portfolio with strategic goals among a pool of awarded projects. The objective of this research is to develop a model capable of generating representative future streams of projects that can be used to assist in strategic planning and portfolio management. Methods This paper reports on an on-going research project aimed at developing and validating a stochastic model of streams of uncertain and unknown future projects and to demonstrate the significance and implications of such uncertainties on project portfolio and strategic planning. The scope of the research is Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) projects. Records of the past 12 years letting information combined with a pool of candidate variables is analyzed to capture characteristics of the time series data and to determine any project characteristic correlations with macroeconomic factors. Results The performances of the various model components presented indicate the viability of an integrated project stream forecaster that predicts, within a simulation environment, the frequencies of projects and empirical distributions of project duration and cost. Conclusion The gap in the current body of knowledge is a lack of consideration of the effects of uncertainties associated with future projects, both known (but yet to be awarded to a contractor) and unknown (although statistically quantifiable). It is evident that companies should not just focus on current known projects but also uncertain and unknown future projects. Such a capability, looking into the future, is key to the effective medium and long-term strategic planning for the company. Contractors can, for example, use these stochastic streams of data to test different bidding strategies and to see how sensitive the performance of their portfolio is to changes in different market factors.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Literature and Literary Theory\", \"Linguistics and Language\", \"Language and Linguistics\", \"Cultural Studies\"]", "language": "it", "length": [48, 44, 1916], "string": "title={Pasquino avvocato.

L\u2019articolo si propone di esaminare l'attivit\u00e0 di sceneggiatore di Vincenzo Talarico. II tratto caratteristico di questo giornalista e scrittore \u00e8 identificato nel contrasto fra l\u2019attrazione per la retorica e l\u2019atteggiamento sarcastico nei confronti della retorica, e quindi nella volont\u00e0 di demolire con l'ironia le maschere pubbliche che coprono i vizi privati degli individui. Tale contrasto pu\u00f2 essere sintetizzato da un lato dalle sue comparse, in qualit\u00e0 di interprete, in vari film nei quali si \u00e8 calato nella parte di un avvocato dall\u2019eloquio ampolloso e dai gesti enfatici, e dall\u2019altro nella frequente presenza, nei film da lui sceneggiati, di scene in cui un discorso celebrativo e retorico viene continuamente interrotto, oppure contrappuntato da commenti sarcastici. Talarico, che Indro Montanelli definisce \u201cspecializzato nell\u2019arte di mormorare\u201d, ha spesso collaborato alla scrittura di film in cui venivano prese di mira le pose monumentali del fascismo. Anche nelle opere \u201cdi genere\u201d (film comici, melodrammi) a cui ha collaborato si ravvisa la presenza di simili contrappunti. I film a cui ha partecipato prevedono spesso lo smascheramento di personaggio dotati di una doppia faccia. L'articolo esamina dettagliatamente le collaborazioni cinematografiche di Talarico, mettendole a confronto con alcuni testi letterari dello stesso autore (in particolare, le pagine su Tersite nel testo Pasquino insanguinato forniscono una guida per la lettura del suo percorso). L\u2019articolo \u2013 che prende in esame anche alcuni testi inediti \u2013 intende quindi contribuire a far emergere legami tra film che gli approcci tradizionali, incentrati sul regista o sui generi, tendono a lasciare in ombra.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Materials Chemistry\", \"Polymers and Plastics\", \"Surfaces, Coatings and Films\"]", "language": "en", "length": [98, 0, 0], "string": "title={Synthesis and properties of styrene-butylacrylate emulsion copolymers modified by silane compounds}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Automotive Engineering\"]", "language": "pt", "length": [103, 0, 840], "string": "title={AVALIA\u00c7\u00c3O DE CUSTO-BENEF\u00cdCIO PARA MANUTEN\u00c7\u00c3O EM TANQUES DE HIDROCARBONETOS DE TRANSFER\u00caNCIA E ESTOCAGEM}, container_title={}, abstract={Para instala\u00e7\u00f5es de refino de petr\u00f3leo, os tanques s\u00e3o ativos fundamentais e t\u00eam como fun\u00e7\u00e3o possibilitar o armazenamento de produtos intermedi\u00e1rio de forma a preservar suas caracter\u00edsticas fundamentais.

This study examines the phenomenology of CV in a unique group of tricultural Southeast Asian American (SEAA) emerging adults who identify with Asian American, White American, and hip hop cultures to understand how it is experienced, the reasons for its use, the extent to which it is conscious/agentic, and how three cultural identities are managed simultaneously. Interpretive phenomenological analyses reveal that CV was used consciously and involved making behavioral and cognitive changes to fit in with out-group members, educate others about SEAA culture, and to distance themselves from in-group members. Importantly, the centrality of SEAA identity most often remained stable despite playing up/down identities. Overall, findings suggest that CV is an essential identity negotiation strategy for tricultural emerging adults that is complementary to alternation/code-switching.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0,

government's policy of issuing Presidential Instruction Number 8 of 2018 concerning Suspension and Evaluation of Oil Palm Plantation Permits and Improvement of Oil Palm Plantations can be interpreted as a step in structuring oil palm plantations in Indonesia as well as providing legal certainty. This paper aims to determine the achievements of the palm oil moratorium based on the Presidential Instruction Number 8 of 2018 and to find out the prospects and challenges faced by the government in implementing the palm oil moratorium program. To answer these problems, this paper uses a statutory approach, a case approach, and a conceptual approach. While the data sources used are secondary data in the form of Presidential Instruction Number 8 of 2018 and others. The results of this study can be concluded that the implementation of the Presidential Instruction regarding the Palm Oil Moratorium has positive implications, especially in preventing the rate of deforestation. The prospect of implementing a palm oil moratorium based on Presidential Instruction Number 8 of 2018 has achieved a conducive business climate and resolved overlapping problems related to palm oil business permits. In addition to these prospects, the government also faces difficult challenges, namely the potential for agrarian conflicts that are still high and law enforcement in a sustainable manner in the oil palm plantation sector it self.Kebijakan pemerintah menerbitkan Instruksi Presiden Nomor 8 Tahun 2018 tentang Penundaan dan Evaluasi Perizinan Perkebunan Kelapa Sawit serta Peningkatan Perkebunan Kelapa Sawit dapat dimaknai sebagai langkah dalam penataan perkebunaan sawit di Indonesia sekaligus memberikan kepastian hukum. Tulisan ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui capaian moratorium sawit berdasarkan Instruksi Presiden Nomor 8 Tahun 2018 dan untuk mengetahui prospek dan tantangan yang dihadapi pemerintah dalam menjalankan program moratorium sawit. Untuk menjawab permasalahan tersebut tulisan ini menggunakan metode pendekatan perundang-undangan, pendekatan kasus, serta pendekatan konseptual. Sedangkan sumber data yang digunakan yaitu data sekunder berupa Instruksi Presiden Nomor 8 Tahun 2018 dan lainnya. Hasil kajian ini dapat disimpulkan bahwa pemberlakuan Instruksi Presiden tentang Moratorium Sawit membawa implikasi positif terutama dalam mencegah laju deforestasi. Prospek dari pemberlakuan moratorium sawit berdasarkan Instruksi Presiden Nomor 8 Tahun 2018 telah tercapainya iklim usaha yang kondusif dan menyelesaikan permasalahan tumpang tindih terkait izin usaha sawit. Selain prospek tersebut pemerintah juga menghadapi tantangan yang tak mudah yakni potensi konflik agraria yang masih tinggi dan penegakan hukum secara berkelanjutan di bidang perkebunan kelapa sawit itu sendiri.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Computer Science Applications\", \"History\", \"Education\"]", "language": "en", "length": [79, 37, 673], "string": "title={Electromagnetics of two-dimensional materials with time-varying carrier density}, container_title={Journal of Physics: Conference Series}, abstract={Abstract The variation of carrier density in two-dimensional materials, such as graphene, creates opportunities for rapid control of guided wave propagation which can find numerous applications in optoelectronics.

The difference in the results stems from the different treatment of the microscopic current during the carrier density changes.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Developmental Biology\", \"Developmental Neuroscience\"]", "language": "en", "length": [89, 0, 0], "string": "title={GABAA receptor subunit expression and assembly in cultured rat cerebellar granule neurons}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation\", \"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [25, 0, 0], "string": "title={Health benefits of tennis}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Filtration and Separation\", \"Analytical Chemistry\"]", "language": "en", "length": [74, 0, 0], "string": "title={Recent progress in separation prediction of counter\u2010current chromatography}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Inorganic Chemistry\", \"Physical and Theoretical Chemistry\"]", "language": "en", "length": [273, 19, 0], "string": "title={Binuclear metal carbonyl DAB complexes. 6.

To this end, atorvastatin solid lipid nanoparticles (ATR-SLNs) were prepared by ultra-sonication technique. The prepared SLNs had a PDI value of \u2264 0.5, and the particle size of nanoparticles was in the range 71.07 \u00b1 1.72 to 202.07 \u00b1 8.40 nm. It was noticed that, when the concentration of lipid in ATR-SLNs increased, the size of nanoparticles and drug entrapment efficiency were also increased. Results showed that a reduction in the HLB of surfactants used in the preparation of SLN caused an increase in the particle size, zeta potential (better stability), and drug entrapment efficiency. Despite Tween and Span are non-ionic surfactants, SLNs containing these surfactants showed a negative zeta potential, and the absolute zeta potential increased when the concentration of Span 80 was at maximum. DSC thermograms, FTIR spectra, and x-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern showed good incorporation of ATR in the nanoparticles without any chemical interaction. In vitro skin permeation results showed that SLN containing atorvastatin was capable of enhancing the dermal delivery of atorvastatin where a higher concentration of atorvastatin can be detected in skin layers. This is a hopeful promise which could be developed for clinical studies of the dermal delivery of atorvastatin nanoparticles as an anti-inflammatory agent.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering\", \"Food Science\"]", "language": "en", "length": [115, 0, 0], "string": "title={Opuntia cladodes as functional ingredient in durum wheat bread: rheological, sensory, and chemical characterization}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Linguistics and Language\", \"Communication\", \"Language and Linguistics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [96, 4, 1341], "string": "title={Writer construction in English and German popularized academic discourse: The uses of we and wir}, container_title={MULT}, abstract={Abstract The present article investigates writer\u2013reader interaction through the construction of writer and reader personae in English and German popular scientific writing by means of first person plural pronouns in subject position. Popular scientific writing only became firmly established as a German-language genre in the last quarter of the 20th century when the high-profile publication Scientific American entered the German news magazine market with a German-language sister issue, featuring German translations of articles from the English magazine and original text production in German. We assume that language contact in the process of translation from English to German influenced both the German translations and original text production in German and helped to shape genre-specific communicative styles in the then emerging genre of popular scientific writing in German. Writer\u2013reader interaction is considered as one aspect of communicative style. Focusing on the contribution of first person plural pronouns to the realization of writer\u2013reader interaction through specific writer and reader personae, it will be shown that, over time,

abstract={Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder that affects mostly young women in which tissue-binding autoantibodies and immune complexes cause damage to organs and tissues. SLE is characterised by aberrant immunological responses that result in the release of higher levels and immunogenic nucleic acids, proteins, and other self-antigens. Autoimmune Haemolytic Anaemia (AIHA) is a condition in which antibodies against red blood cells are present. It is classified as a warm and cold antibody AIHA. The causes of warm antibody AIHA are autoimmune illnesses, infections, or even malignancy. The presence of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies can indicate warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (warm agglutinin anaemia), which is characterised by fatigue and other constitutional symptoms. Although, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia can be a component of the SLE spectrum, warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia as the first manifestation of SLE is exceedingly rare. This case report describes a case of a 23-years-old female who presented to the hospital with complaints of breathlessness and chest pain. After evaluation she was found to have pericardial tamponade and AIHA. Pericardiocentesis was done and further investigations confirmed the diagnosis of SLE. She was treated with injectable methylprednisolone, injectable antibiotics, Tab. hydroxychloroquine, Tab. febuxostat ,Tab. colchicine, oral antidiuretic, oral levothyroxine and other supportive management. The lack of unambiguous pathognomonic characteristics or tests, coupled with the variable presentation of SLE, makes diagnosis tricky. Overall, AIHA can be an initial presentation as well as a part of other disease processes, emphasising the significance of a comprehensive work in patients with AIHA.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0,

These methods rely heavily on insights into the mathematical model governing the physical system. However, in complex systems, such as autonomous underwater vehicles performing the dual objective of path following and collision avoidance, decision making becomes nontrivial. We propose a solution using state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to develop autonomous agents capable of achieving this hybrid objective without having a priori knowledge about the goal or the environment.
