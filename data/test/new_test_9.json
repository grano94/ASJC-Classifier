Methanol was evaporated in a rotary evaporator. Different concentrations (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5%) of methanolic extracts were prepared, and their antifungal activities were studied against Macrophomina phaseolina, using malt extract broth as growth medium. In general, extracts of all plant parts showed antifungal activities to variable extents. The highest antifungal activity occurred due to methanolic extract of leaves, followed by stem and root extracts, resulting in 10-74%, 6-57% and 11-39% reduction in fungal biomass over control, respectively. Inflorescence extract showed the least antifungal activity, resulting in 2-30% reduction in fungal biomass over control. There was a linear and inverse relationship between extract concentrations and fungal biomass for extracts of all the four parts. GC-MS analysis showed that there were 10 compounds in most effective methanolic leaf extract. Among these, 10-octadecanoic acid, methyl ester (26.442%), 2H-1-benzopyran, 6,7-dimethoxy-2-2-dimethyl (20.195%), hexadecanoic acid, methyl ester (15.752%) and 9,12-octadecadienoic acid (Z,Z)-, methyl ester (12.628%) were predominant compounds in the extract that may be responsible for antifungal activity.

This article reports seismological observations of four thunderstorms through the spring and summer of 2019, as recorded by the distributed acoustic sensing fiber-optic array (4.9 km) on the Penn State campus in State College, Pennsylvania. With a dense sensor array in the local region, we are able to construct the seismic full waveform response of the thunderstorm events (hereafter referred to as thunderquakes) and track the wave propagation across the array. We use a time-domain grid search to obtain the back azimuth and slowness of the waves, and a modified Geiger\u2019s method to pinpoint source locations of the thunderquakes. Correlated with the time of the recorded signal, this data allows reconstruction of thunderstorm movement as well as offering measurements of the seismic velocity.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0,

In a similar study, Stark concludes that the diffusion of the Isis cult and Christianity were intertwined. These claims are evaluated in a new study that accesses the impact of city size, distance from Rome, religious pluralism and cultural continuity on the diffusion of the Isis cult throughout 22 major cities of the Roman Empire. Updated data on the diffusion of the Isis cult are utilized and the data are subjected to rank-order correlation analysis and binary logistic regression analysis.

Though both are associated with right hemisphere cerebral dysfunction, notably stroke, each disorder had its own distinct literature. Anosognosia, as coined by Babinski in 1914, describes patients who seem to have no idea of their paralysis, despite general cognitive preservation. Certain patients seem more than unaware, with apparent resistance to awareness. More extreme, and qualitatively distinct, is denial of hemiplegia. Various interpretations of pathogenesis are still deliberated. As accounts of its captivating manifestations grew, anosognosia was established as a prominent symbol of neurological and psychic disturbance accompanying (right-hemisphere) stroke. Although reports of specific neglect-related symptomatology appeared earlier, not until nearly 2 decades after anosognosia\u2019s inaugural definition was neglect formally defined by Brain, paving a path spanning some years, to depict a class of disorder with heterogeneous variants. Disordered awareness of body and extrapersonal space with right parietal lesions, and other symptom variations, were gathered under the canopy of neglect. Viewed as a disorder of corporeal awareness, explanatory interpretations involve mechanisms of extinction and perceptual processing, disturbance of spatial attention, and others. Odd alterations involving apparent concern, attitudes, or belief characterize many right hemisphere conditions. Anosognosia and neglect are re-examined, from the perspective of unawareness, the nature of belief, and its baffling distortions.

inability of the heart to supply enough blood flow to the body's metabolic tissues is known as heart failure (H.F.). A patient's tolerance for physical activity is described by the N.Y.H.A. Classification of H.F., updated in 1994 to include objective assessments of heart function and disease. The phrase \"cardiopulmonary disease\" is used in medicine to refer to various dangerous diseases that affect the heart and lungs. Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (C.O.P.D.) are the two main cardiopulmonary conditions caused by cigarette use (C.O.P.D.). A severe respiratory infection brings on the lung condition known as pneumonia. The tiny sacs called alveoli that make up a healthy person's lungs are filled with air as they breathe. Pneumonia causes the alveoli to fill with pus and fluid, making breathing challenging and limiting oxygen intake. A metabolic syndrome is a group of risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. It is often referred to as Syndrome X. (CVD). Despite being widespread, it has not received enough attention and occasionally goes unnoticed. As primary care practitioners, we must keep an eye out for these people so that early identification, intervention, and prevention can be put into practice.A Chinese lady with metabolic syndrome is described in the following paragraphs. Present complaint and investigation: on March 28, 2022, a 62-year-old female was hospitalized at A.V.B.R. Hospital with breathing difficulty, lower limb swelling, chest pain, mucus in the throat and lungs, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. Twelve days have passed. Investigation: Haemoglobin is decreased by 10.7gm, WBC count 11,000 per microliter, Total R.B.C. count increased 5.84 million /cell, M.C.H. level Decreased 70fl, MCH IS DECREASE 22.8 pico-gm. Therefore CT report should be interpreted in correlation with clinical &pathological findings. PAST HISTORY: he was admitted eight days before outside the hospital for the same complaints on 26/02/2022. Pneumonia one year back for which she symptoms in 2000 for fibroid he took treatment. After the physical examination and investigation, diagnosed RESPIRATORY ACIDOSIS WITH OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA WITH HYPERTENSION. Conclusion: He responded well to all medication and doctor care and made a good recovery.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Oncology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [54, 0, 0], "string": "title={A clearance test could prevent 5-fluorouracil toxicity}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [79, 0, 2046], "string": "title={Abstract P198: Is Directly Measured LDL Clinically Equivalent to Calculated LDL}, container_title={}, abstract={Background: LDL cholesterol can either be calculated or measured directly. Clinical guidelines recommend using calculated LDL to guide therapy, as the evidence base for lipid management is derived almost exclusively from trials using calculated LDL, with direct measurement of LDL being reserved for those not fasting or significant hypertriglyceridemia. Our aim was to determine the clinical equivalence of directly measured LDL and fasting calculated LDL. Design: Eighty-one subjects had at least 1 calculated and direct LDL performed simultaneously; 64 had a repeat lipid assessment after 4 to 6 weeks of therapy, resulting in 145 pairs of calculated and direct LDL. Correlation between direct and calculated LDL was determined using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The relationship between direct and calculated LDL was also evaluated from a clinical perspective. Direct and calculated LDL were considered \u201cclinically concordant\u201d when the difference between calculated and direct LDL fulfilled 3 criteria: 1) were considered \u201cclinically discordant\u201d when the difference between calculated and direct LDL fulfilled 3 criteria: 1) \u2265 12% difference (incremental LDL lowering provided by 2 statin titration steps, e.g. from simvastatin 20 to 80 mg), 2) \u2265 10 mg/dL difference, and 3) placement in different ATP III LDL cut points. Results: There was significant correlation between direct and calculated LDL(r=0.93). Clinical concordance between calculated and direct LDL was present in 40% of patients. Clinical discordance was noted in 25% of patients. One-third of patients had > 15 mg/dL difference between direct and calculated LDL, while 25% had > 20 mg/dL difference. In 47% of subjects, the difference between direct and calculated LDL at baseline and follow-up changed by a minimum of 10% or 10 mg/dL. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that directly measured LDL is not clinically equivalent to calculated LDL. This puts into question the current recommendation of using direct LDL in situations where calculated LDL would be inaccurate.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine\", \"Surgery\"]", "language": "en", "length": [85, 16, 0], "string": "title={Prophylactic routine posterior pericardiotomy: Should we perform it in every patient?}, container_title={JTCVS Techniques}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Urology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [128, 0, 0], "string": "title={URETERAL RECONSTRUCTION: SMALL INTESTINE SUBMUCOSA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF STRICTURES AND DEFECTS OF THE UPPER THIRD OF THE URETER}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Surgery\"]", "language": "en", "length": [23, 0, 0], "string": "title={Gastric secretory tests}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Management Science and Operations Research\", \"Mechanical Engineering\", \"Energy Engineering and Power Technology\"]", "language": "tr", "length": [79, 0, 0], "string": "title={17.

Approximately 990,000 people are diagnosed with GC worldwide, of whom close to 75% die from this disease. Despite the overall decrease in the global incidence of GC since the 1930s, GC disease is one of the top ten most diagnosed cancers and leading cause of cancer death in Puerto Rico. Risk factors for the development of gastric cancer include: male sex, older age, Helicobacter pylori status, tobacco smoking, diet, living in places with high altitude, low socioeconomic status, and being part of the Asian, Hispanic, and African American communities. However, the prevalence of H. pylori, one of the main risk factors for GC, is unknown in the Puerto Rican Hispanic population. Prevalence of H. pylori infection is influenced by socioeconomic, demographic, and ethnic factors. Thus, this study aimed to determine the seroprevalence and associated risk factors for H. pylori infection among a sub-sample of Puerto Rican Hispanics. Methods: A cross sectional study was designed using an existing population-based biobank that comprised of 1,645 serum samples collected in the parent study \u201cEpidemiology of hepatitis C in the household population of Puerto Rico\u201d. The Premier\u2122 H. pylori enzyme immunoassay (Meridian Bioscience, Inc.) was used to determine the seroprevalence according to the manufacturer's specifications. A prevalence estimate of H. pylori was estimated using logistic regression models according to sociodemographic characteristics. Differences between groups according to H. pylori status were assessed using Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables, and \u03c7\u00b2 test or Fisher's exact test, when appropriate, for categorical variables. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the prevalence ratio (PR) with 95% CIs for H. pylori seropositivity. All data was analyzed using Stata for Windows release 13.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA). Results: A total of 528 representative serum samples (by age, gender, population density, and years of education) from the 1654 were analyzed. The majority of participants were females (55.3%), aged 30-49 years (50.2%), born in PR (89.6%), had \u2265 12 years of education (76.3%), had an annual family income &lt; $20,000 (64.1%), and had health insurance (88.8%). The overall seroprevalence of H. pylori was 35.2% (95% CI=31.2-39.5; females 54.8%). Statistically significant differences in terms of age, place of birth, marital status, years of education, annual family income, type of health insurance, place of residence, and population density were observed when comparing individuals with seropositive to H. pylori and individuals without (p&lt;0.05). Seroprevalence of H. pylori increased according to age-strata; where those ages 30-49 had prevalence of 1.49 (95% CI 1.01-2.18), while those ages 50-64 had higher prevalence of 2.28 (95% CI 1.57-3.33). Individuals born in Puerto Rico had higher seropositive prevalence of H. pylori, compared to individuals not born on the island (PR=2.29; 95% CI=1.24-4.20). The prevalence of H. pylori among individuals living in high-density population areas was higher than those living in low-density areas (PR=0.71, 95% CI=0.56-0.90, p-value=0.005). Conclusions: This is the first report of the seroprevalence of H. pylori in the Puerto Rican Hispanic population. The observed prevalence of H. pylori in Puerto Rican Hispanics is lower than rates reported for US Hispanics and similar to US non-Hispanics. The lower prevalence of H. pylori among individuals living in high-density population areas may be a surrogate for wealth and/or environmental exposures. In summary, the observed health disparities among the Puerto Rican population with regards to H. pylori seroprevalence may impact the incidence of gastric neoplasia and warrant further investigation.

(CVDs) are widespread in cancer patients, exacerbating their condition and lowering their prognosis. Approximately 15% of cancer patients have a coexisting CVD. Stroke may occur after the initial cancer diagnosis or before the diagnosis of malignant disease. The underlying causes of stroke in cancer patients are distinct from those in noncancer patients and are related to both cancer itself and the type of treatment. Cardio-embolism, large vessel atherosclerosis, and small vessel occlusion have all been identified as important causes of ischemic stroke, but nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis has been documented only infrequently. We present a case of a 64-year-old female with recurrent ischemic stroke of unknown cause and involving different arterial territories, who was discovered to have metastatic pancreatic cancer. The initial workup with brain imaging revealed multiple acute/subacute ischemic strokes and a negative cardiac assessment.

These baking-associated stresses exert severe injury to yeast cells, mainly due to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to cell death and reduced fermentation ability. Thus, there is a great need for a baker's yeast strain with higher tolerance to baking-associated stresses. Recently, we revealed a novel antioxidative mechanism in a laboratory yeast strain that is involved in stress-induced nitric oxide (NO) synthesis from proline via proline oxidase Put1 and N-acetyltransferase Mpr1. We also found that expression of the proline-feedback inhibition-less sensitive mutant \u03b3-glutamyl kinase (Pro1-I150T) and the thermostable mutant Mpr1-F65L resulted in an enhanced fermentation ability of baker's yeast in bread dough after freeze-thaw stress and air-drying stress, respectively. However, baker's yeast strains with high fermentation ability under multiple baking-associated stresses have not yet been developed. Results We constructed a self-cloned diploid baker's yeast strain with enhanced proline and NO synthesis by expressing Pro1-I150T and Mpr1-F65L in the presence of functional Put1. The engineered strain increased the intracellular NO level in response to air-drying stress, and the strain was tolerant not only to oxidative stress but also to both air-drying and freeze-thaw stresses probably due to the reduced intracellular ROS level. We also showed that the resultant strain retained higher leavening activity in bread dough after air-drying and freeze-thaw stress than that of the wild-type strain. On the other hand, enhanced stress tolerance and fermentation ability did not occur in the put1-deficient strain. This result suggests that NO is synthesized in baker's yeast from proline in response to oxidative stresses that induce ROS generation and that increased NO plays an important role in baking-associated stress tolerance. Conclusions In this work, we clarified the importance of Put1- and Mpr1-mediated NO generation from proline to the baking-associated stress tolerance in industrial baker's yeast. We also demonstrated that baker's yeast that enhances the proline and NO synthetic pathway by expressing the Pro1-I150T and Mpr1-F65L variants showed improved fermentation ability under multiple baking-associated stress conditions. From a biotechnological perspective, the enhancement of proline and NO synthesis could be promising for breeding novel baker's yeast strains.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

respiratory diseases that fluctuate widely with regard to clinical symptoms and airway obstruction, complicating treatment and prediction of exacerbations. Time series of respiratory impedance obtained by the forced oscillation technique are a convenient tool to study the respiratory system with high temporal resolution. In previous studies it was suggested that power-law-like fluctuations exist also in the healthy lung and that respiratory system impedance variability differs in asthma. In this study we elucidate such differences in a population of well-characterized subjects with asthma ( n = 13, GINA 1+2), COPD ( n = 12, GOLD I+II), and controls ( n = 10) from time series at single frequency (12 min, f = 8 Hz). Maximum likelihood estimation did not rule out power-law behavior, accepting the null hypothesis in 17/35 cases ( P > 0.05) and with significant differences in exponents for COPD ( P 0.14). In a second approach, we considered asthma and COPD as dynamic diseases, corresponding to changes of unknown parameters in a deterministic system. The similarity in shape between the combined probability distributions of normalized resistance and reactance was quantified by Wasserstein distances and reliably distinguished the two diseases (cross-validated predictive accuracy 0.80; sensitivity 0.83, specificity 0.77 for COPD). Wasserstein distances between 3+3 dimensional phase space reconstructions resulted in marginally better classification (accuracy 0.84, sensitivity 0.83, specificity 0.85). These latter findings suggest that the dynamics of respiratory impedance contain valuable information for the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with asthma and COPD, whereas the value of the stochastic approach is not clear presently.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Data were collected twice in China, and the sample included 66 leaders and 350 followers. Leader\u2013follower power distance value incongruence was found to be associated with the psychological workplace strain experienced by followers, indicating that incongruence was a stressor for this group and further influenced their withdrawal behavior. Moreover, incongruence had asymmetrical effects; that is, followers experienced higher psychological workplace strain when their power distance was lower than that of their leaders, compared with when their power distance was higher. The authors also found that the leader\u2019s role can make a difference, as the leaders\u2019 political skill mitigated the effect of value incongruence on their followers\u2019 psychological workplace strain.

They ask which of the two official languages has a higher economic return in terms of employment and earning. This study examines how ability and proficiency in Canada's two official languages, separately and/or jointly, influences immigrants' quick absorption into the labour market.Design/methodology/approachThe study uses all three waves of the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Canada (LSIC) and employs logistic regression on the relationship between employability, language ability/proficiency and various non-linguistic factors.FindingsThe study reports that language ability in French is as valuable as language ability in English for immigrants who are aspiring to work, full-time or part-time, when they arrive in Canada. The advantages of language ability and proficiency continue a few years after an immigrant's arrival. Using disaggregated speaking, reading and writing competencies, the authors observe that speaking proficiency in English has a greater impact on employability than reading and writing in English.Originality/valueThere are very few studies looking at the effects of language ability and proficiency on the employability of immigrants in countries with multiple official languages. Most studies are mainly focused on earning and not employability. This study is focused on employability, particularly in the context of Canada.

Due to its light weight and high strength, it is applied in the various commercial purposes such as window, doors, construction member etc. However, machining of aluminium alloys using conventional machining methods is difficult. In this present investigation, an endeavour has been made to drill TiB2 in situ aluminium metal matrix composite alloy developed using stir casting method. During the casting two different salts namely K2TiF6 and KBF4 are added with matrix materials to form TiB2. The paper is studied the surface roughness (SR) of drilled TiB2 in situ aluminium metal matrix composite viz speed, feed rate and TiB2 addition. Empirical relationship is developed for SR in order to identify the dominating factors. The percentage contribution of SR is 96.35% that showed the empirical model is adequate. The normal probability plot showed the points of residuals are equally distributed over the straight line. The lack of fit value was 3.65 which is less than the standard point. Therefore, the SR model is satisfactory. SR increased with increasing of speed, feed rate and addition of TiB2. The removal of TiB2 particles causes small pits and voids due to the inclusion of reinforcement. The minimum SR was achieved at lowest speed (1260 rpm), feed rate (0.05 mm rev\u22121) and TiB2 addition (2%). As speed and feed increased, the surface hardness increased.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

As well as the liquor cycle from digestion, clarification, precipitation, evaporation and back to digestion (including flash cooling and heating steps), calcination to alumina in a circulating fluid bed furnace was simulated. The present study not only covers temperature and concentration ranges from boehmite digestion to gibbsite precipitation, it also permits exploration of boehmite precipitation as a potential energy saving modification of the process. Furthermore, the simulation is able to predict the accumulation and precipitation of undesirable impurities in various stages of the liquor circuit. It also identifies possible reductions in the overall energy consumption of the Bayer process.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

The quality and quantity of food available to children affect their nutritional status, with implications for long-term health and development. In Burkina Faso, households rely on rainfed agriculture, but climate change is making crop production unreliable. We explore spatial patterns of growing season quality on dimensions of nutritional status and complementary feeding practices in children 6\u201323 months. Methods. The 2017 Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 (PMA2020) nutritional survey was spatially integrated with a contemporaneous remotely sensed drought indicator, the Water Requirement Satisfaction Index (WRSI), which captures local anomalous growing season conditions. Multi-level mixed-effects logistic regression models were estimated to explore the effects of WRSI on child mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) score (indicating malnutrition), and two components of complementary feeding practices, adjusting for demographic and household characteristics. Results. The data set included 1,721 children. Higher WRSI values (better agricultural conditions and crop performance) were associated with 3% lower odds of malnutrition (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.971; 95% confidence interval (CI): [0.942, 1.00]) and 7% higher odds of a child attaining minimum dietary diversity (OR = 1.07; 95% CI: [1.01, 1.14]). Undernourished mothers were significantly (p Conclusions.

container_title={}, abstract={Abstract. Central and western Europe were affected by a compressional tectonic event in the Late Cretaceous, caused by the convergence of Iberia and Europe. Basement uplifts, inverted graben structures, and newly formed marginal troughs are the main expressions of crustal shortening. Although the maximum activity occurred during a short period of time between 90 and 75 Ma, the exact timing of this event is still unclear. Dating of the start and end of Late Cretaceous basin inversion gives very different results depending on the method applied. On the basis of borehole data, facies, and thickness maps, the timing of basin reorganization was reconstructed for several basins in central Europe. The obtained data point to a synchronous start of basin inversion at 95 Ma (Cenomanian), 5 Myr earlier than commonly assumed. The end of the Late Cretaceous compressional event is difficult to pinpoint in central Europe, because regional uplift and salt migration disturb the signal of shifting marginal troughs. Late Campanian to Paleogene strata deposited unconformably on inverted structures indicate slowly declining uplift rates during the latest Cretaceous.

Scholars agreed that comics are graphic mediums and cultural artefacts that significantly contribute to the visual community of the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the comic artists in Malaysia, Ernest Ng, initially published his comics online and later converted them into three volumes of comic books entitled CovidBall Z Volume 1 (2020a), 2 (2020b) and 3 (2021). The objective of this paper is to undertake a content analysis of the portrayals of the various state machinery figures both from the government and opposition sides (i.e., ministers, politicians and government officers) in their roles in combating COVID-19. Additionally, the analysis wishes to uncover contemporary attitudes Ng uses such as symbolism, exaggeration and irony, among others, to convey his views on the current issue in obvious and subtle ways. In analysing the data, this study employed data analysis techniques in the form of descriptive content analysis. It was found that the social commentaries presented in Ng\u2019s comics via the plot depict the existence of sexism, unfair treatment, and prejudice by several characters which lead to bully culture in the midst of the political metaphorical depiction of war and heroism among Malaysian state machinery figures. The images in his comics help people analyse, reflect on, and interpret our experiences by informing, providing meaning, and illustrating the COVID-19 outbreak narrative.

Standard deconvolution techniques suppose that the wavelet is minimum phase but generally make no assumptions about the amplitude distribution of the primary reflection coefficient sequence. For a white reflection sequence the assumption of a Gaussian distribution means that recovery of the true phase of the wavelet is impossible; however, a non-Gaussian distribution in theory allows recovery of the phase. It is generally recognized that primary reflection coefficients typically have a non-Gaussian amplitude distribution.

This is the basis of the MTT assay, which is among the most widely used screening methods to evaluate cell viability and proliferation. When testing the effects of cholesterol products on the viability of human pulmonary epithelial-like A549 cells using trypan blue staining (cell numbers) and the MTT assay, results were inconsistent. The MTT assay indicated greater than 50% loss of viability with exposure of cells to cholesterol, whereas there was no decrease in viability indicated by trypan blue exclusion and propidium iodide uptake. A similar decrease in MTT reduction was obtained upon cholesterol treatment in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs) and human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) without loss of viability. This suggested a direct interference of cholesterol with the assay. However, using a cell-free system, there was no decrease in the reduction of MTT by ascorbic acid during incubation with a similar concentration of cholesterol. Light microscopy revealed enhanced exocytosis of formazan granules in presence of cholesterol. Incubation with apolipoprotein A-1 decreased cholesterol-mediated inhibition of MTT assay. These studies indicate decreased MTT reduction as a result of enhanced exocytosis of formazan due to cholesterol. A careful validation of viability assay procedures is therefore suggested in experiments where cholesterol is a constituent, to avoid a potential bias in concluding results of cytotoxicity studies.}",

This multisystem disorder primarily affects the central nervous system, the gastrointestinal, and the skeletal systems. In this article, we describe the first Mexican patient diagnosed by ES. The homozygous c.433C>T (p.Arg145*) variant of the OTUD6B gene confirmed this intellectual disability syndrome. In addition to seizures and other more frequently reported manifestations of this condition, this is the third patient with associated hypothyroidism and hypogammaglobulinemia, underscoring the value of screening for these conditions in other patients. The current challenge with this patient is to ensure medical management of his seizures and provide him with a better quality of life. The possibilities of additional therapeutic approaches may increase by understanding the physiopathology of the involved pathways.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

More particularly, some clausal structures are discussed which show a high number of structural and semantic correspondences with non-agentive -er nominals. Whereas in English, the most important clausal agnate turns out to be the middle construction (e.g. this book reads easily), Dutch non-agentive -er nominals are shown to agnate with various structures, notably middle formation: especially the occurrence of intransitive or 'circumstantial' middles (e.g. asfalt fietst prettiger dan grind 'asphalt cycles better than gravel'), and the frequent use of 'let'-constructions in contexts where English would use a middle (e.g. dat boek laat zich makkelijk lezen [that book lets itself easily read], i.e. that book reads easily) offer evidence of the Dutch potential to construe non-agentive entities as subjects.

Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are recommended in RA (2). However, vaccination coverage of these patients remains very low. Five years ago, we found in a previous study that vaccination rates in France were 55% for pneumococcal and 60% for influenza vaccines (3).Objectives:The aim of our study was to evaluate the vaccination rate among RA patients, compare it with our previous results, and identify factors associated with non-vaccination.Methods:We conducted a cross sectional multicentric observational study in the rheumatology departments of 5 university hospitals in France. Data were collected from December 2018 to July 2019. Outpatients and hospitalized adult patients with RA according to the ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria were included. Data were collected during a single visit through an anonymous questionnaire completed by the patients. Pearson Chi-squared analysis and multivariable logistic regression were used to compare characteristics of vaccinated versus non vaccinated patients.Results:584 patients (77.9% of women, mean age 61.8\u00b112.6 years old) were included. 81.7% were RF and/or ACPA positive, with a mean RA duration of 15.7\u00b110.5 years, 58.2% were treated with methotrexate (MTX), and 68.6% with a biologic. Vaccination rate against pneumococcal was 78.9% (versus 55% in 2013, pConclusion:Vaccination rate against pneumococcal increased over the last 5 years but remained stable for influenza vaccine in French RA patients. This could be improved with patient\u2019s information and education, especially in patients age under 65, biologic na\u00efve and with a bad opinion about vaccination.References:[1] Doran MF, Crowson CS et al.

The collection of information has been carried out through three structured questionnaires, elaborated ad hoc and intended for each of the participating groups.

Based upon type and severity, the conditions may vary from superficial to deep systemic skin infections. Niacinamide, an amide analog of vitamin B3 which was conventionally utilized as a food supplement, is now explored for the management of skin disorders. Being a powerhouse on its own, it is not stored inside the body naturally and has to be acquired from external sources. Areas covered: This review is an attempt to disclose the physiology, pharmacology, and highlight the dermatological potentials of niacinamide, discussing its pharmacological mechanisms, varied commercially available treatments, and novel approaches, i.e., in research and patented formulations. Results: Niacinamide has been verified in treating almost every skin disorder, viz. aging, hyperpigmentation, acne, psoriasis, pruritus, dermatitis, fungal infections, epidermal melasma, non-melanoma skin cancer, etc. It has been reported to possess numerous properties, for instance, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antipruritic, and anticancer, which makes it an ideal ingredient for varied dermal therapies. Long term use of niacinamide, regardless of the skin type, paves the way for new skin cells, makingskin healthier, brighter, and hydrated. Conclusion: Niacinamide possesses a variety of positive characteristics in the field of dermatology. Novel approaches are warranted over current treatments which could bypass the above shortcomings and form an effective and stable system. Hence, niacinamide has the potential to become an individual and a productive component with wide future scope.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

In this paper, HDPE and PE-BIO films were exposed to UV-B radiation (320-280 nm) at different exposure times, 0-60 days. The effects of UV radiation in samples of HDPE and PE-BIO were characterized using infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (ATR). The results show that the exposed materials undergo changes in their molecular structure, due to the infrared bands formed which corresponds to the photo-oxidation of HDPE and PE films when submitted

to Age and to Deductive Training}, container_title={Neural Plasticity}, abstract={Electrical brain activity modulation in terms of changes in its intensity and spatial distribution is a function of age and task demand. However, the dynamics of brain modulation is unknown when it depends on external factors such as training. The aim of this research is to verify the effect of deductive reasoning training on the modulation in the brain activity of healthy younger and older adults (N=47 (mean age of 21 \u00b1 3.39) and N=38 (mean age of 68.92 \u00b1 5.72)). The analysis reveals the benefits of training, showing that it lowers cerebral activation while increasing the number of correct responses in the trained reasoning task (p0.001). The brain source generators were identified by time-averaging low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) current density images. In both groups, a bilateral overactivation associated with the task and not with age was identified. However, while the profile of bilateral activation in younger adults was symmetrical in anterior areas, in the older ones, the profile was located asymmetrically in anterior and posterior areas. Consequently, bilaterality may be a marker of how the brain adapts to maintain cognitive function in demanding tasks in both age groups. However, the differential bilateral locations across age groups indicate that the tendency to brain modulation is determined by age.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Earth-Surface Processes\", \"Geology\", \"Pollution\", \"Soil Science\", \"Water Science and Technology\", \"Environmental Chemistry\", \"Global and Planetary Change\"]", "language": "en", "length": [47, 0, 0], "string": "title={Reviews on books, internet and scientific media}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Museology\", \"Archeology\", \"History\"]", "language": "en", "length": [186, 0, 0], "string": "title={Shaul E.

Nano emulations (NEs) are colloidal nano-sized particles that enhance the therapeutic efficacy of TRE and minimize adverse effects. This study is aimed at developing a TRE-loaded NE (NE-TRE) and at assessing the therapeutic effects of the formulation in acne vulgaris lesions, compared to conventional 0.05% TRE emulsion. Method: The high energy emulsification method was used to make NE-TRE. After obtaining stable NE, particle characterization and physicochemical properties were evaluated under accelerated conditions. Conducting a clinical study, we compared the therapeutic effects of NE-TRE and 0.05% TRE emulsion by comparing the number of acne lesions and porphyrin production in both sides of the face. Results and Conclusion: We successfully developed stable nanoparticles. It was a stable oil-in-water emulsion with particle size of about 150 nm, and containing circular and separated particles. In a pilot clinical study, the number of acne lesions as well as the size and intensity of porphyrin production significantly reduced after topical application of NE-TRE. This formula shows proper efficiency and good loading capacity of TRE in the drug delivery system.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Algebra and Number Theory\"]", "language": "en", "length": [15, 0, 0], "string": "title={Editorial Board}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation\", \"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [155, 39, 2010], "string": "title={Partial Superior Capsular Reconstruction to Augment Arthroscopic Repair of Massive Rotator Cuff Tears Using Autogenous Biceps Tendon: Effect on Retear Rate}, container_title={The American Journal of Sports Medicine}, abstract={Background: Massive rotator cuff tears have a high incidence of postoperative retear that can reach 90%. It is still unclear which intervention may reduce the incidence of retear and improve the functional and clinical outcomes. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical and structural outcomes at 2 years after repair of reparable massive rotator cuff tears with and without the use of partial superior capsular reconstruction (pSCR), using the autologous long head of the biceps tendon (LHBT) as a graft. It was hypothesized that augmentation with a pSCR would decrease retear rates. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: The authors compared arthroscopic repair of massive posterosuperior rotator cuff tears with and without augmentation using the LHBT for pSCR between 2015 and 2017. After applying the selection criteria, 106 patients were included in the study and distributed into 2 groups of 50 and 56 patients. Patients in the first group (50 patients) underwent arthroscopic repair without use of the LHBT (AR group), and patients in the second group (56 patients) underwent arthroscopic repair with use of the LHBT for pSCR (AR-LHBT group). The structural outcome was evaluated by ultrasound at 2 years of follow-up. Function and pain were evaluated preoperatively and at the 2-year follow-up using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score and visual analog scale (VAS). Pre- and postoperative active range of motion, including forward elevation, external rotation, and abduction, were also documented. Results: No significant differences were found between groups regarding the baseline characteristics. After 24 months, both groups showed significant improvement from preoperative ASES scores, VAS score, and active range of motion ( P Conclusion: Use of the LHBT for pSCR to augment massive rotator cuff tears resulted in markedly lower retear rates and modestly improved pain and function outcomes compared with repair alone.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

However, while the online wine business is growing and the number of online buyers is increasing in Hungary, the impact of online marketing and social media use on their profitability is understudied. The research aims to apply qualitative data collection techniques such as web-content analysis to capture the elements of online marketing as an engine of stimulating profitability. For this reason, the top 12 Hungarian online wine shops were analyzed. The results revealed that the Hungarian online wine business is highly concentrated, the five main players (Vinotrade, T\u00f6rley, Grape-Vine, Borh\u00e1l\u00f3, and Bort\u00e1rsas\u00e1g) attract most buyers and account for the highest profit rate. Using online marketing channels and social media, wine shops can positively influence their profitability. In addition to the classic online marketing tools of the Internet (blogs, newsletters), social networks (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Pinterest) of wine shops become highly relevant to boost wine sales.

This provides an independent window to observe and constrain the PPS PR (k) along different k scales as compared to CMB Temperature Power Spectrum. The Weak Lensing Power Spectrum does not contain secondary variations in power and hence is cleaner, unlike the Temperature Power Spectrum which suffers from lensing which must be addressed during PPS reconstructions. We demonstrate that the physical behaviour of the weak lensing kernel is unique and reconstructs broad features over k. We provide an in-depth analysis of the error propagation using simulated data and Monte-Carlo sampling, using Planck best-fit cosmological parameters to simulate the data with cosmic variance limited error bars. The error and initial condition analyses provide a clear picture of the optimal reconstruction region for the estimator while providing a detailed statistical insight of the results. We also provide an algorithm for PR (k) sampling sparsity to be used based on the given data and errors, to optimize statistical significance. Eventually we plan to use this method on actual mission data and provide a cross reference to PPS reconstructed from other sectors and any possible features in them.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0,

serious pregnancy complication characterized by suboptimal placentation, leading to increased vascular resistance and generalized endothelial dysfunction. A promising treatment is sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor that enhances nitric oxide (NO) mediated vasodilation. Although there are currently sildenafil trials ongoing in pregnant women, the effects of sildenafil on the placenta are still unknown. Placentas of healthy (n=17), early-onset (Eo)PE (n=6) and late-onset (Lo)PE (n=5) pregnancies were dually perfused, pre-constricted with serotonin, and subsequently exposed to the NO donor SNP in the absence or presence of 1 \u03bcmol/L sildenafil. Two healthy placentas were perfused with sildenafil on the maternal side to study placental transfer. Placental protein expression of PDE5, PDE1A, eNOS and iNOS was assessed using Western blot. Mean baseline pressure \u00b1SEM was significantly lower (p-6 M SNP in healthy (mean pressure decrease 4.3\u00b10.8 vs. 8.1\u00b11.9 mmHg, p=0.1) and LoPE placentas (3.0\u00b11.0 vs. 7.3\u00b13.2 mmHg), while no improvement was seen in EoPE placentas (6.0\u00b12.0 vs. 5.0\u00b11.0 mmHg). When sildenafil was added at the maternal side, average fetal-maternal concentration ratio was 0.22 after 3 hours of perfusion, as compared to 0.86 for antipyrine, a freely diffusing molecule. Placental levels of PDE1A tended to be higher in PE (p=0.08), while no differences in expression of PDE5, eNOS and iNOS were observed between PE and healthy placentas. Our study reveals that PE placentas have a significantly lower baseline pressure compared to healthy placentas, possibly due to lower resistance in the feto-placental vasculature as a compensation mechanism for the increased resistance in the spiral arteries. Although sildenafil tended to enhance vasodilation in healthy and LoPE placentas, it did not have those beneficial effects in EoPE. Possibly PDE1A-selective inhibitors should be applied in PE, or PDE is not the appropriate target for restoring disturbed vasodilation.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Virology\", \"Insect Science\", \"Immunology\", \"Microbiology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [97, 0, 1691], "string": "title={Generation of an Adenovirus Vector Lacking E1, E2a, E3, and All of E4 except Open Reading Frame 3}, container_title={}, abstract={ABSTRACT Toxicity and immunity associated with adenovirus backbone gene expression is an important hurdle to overcome for successful gene therapy. Recent efforts to improve adenovirus vectors for in vivo use have focused on the sequential deletion of essential early genes. Adenovirus vectors have been constructed with the E1 gene deleted and with this deletion in combination with an E2a, E2b, or E4 deletion. We report here a novel vector (Av4 orf 3nBg) lacking E1, E2a, and all of E4 except open reading frame 3 (ORF3) and expressing a \u03b2-galactosidase reporter gene. This vector was generated by transfection of a plasmid carrying the full-length vector sequence into A30.S8 cells that express E1 and E2a but not E4. Production was subsequently performed in an E1-, E2a-, and E4-complementing cell line. We demonstrated with C57BL/6 mice that the Av4 orf 3nBg vector effected gene transfer with an efficiency comparable to that of the Av3nBg (wild-type E4) vector but that the former exhibited a higher level of \u03b2-galactosidase expression. This observation suggests that E4 ORF3 alone is able to enhance RNA levels from the \u03b2-galactosidase gene when the Rous sarcoma virus promoter is used to drive transgene expression in the mouse liver. In addition, we observed less liver toxicity in mice injected with the Av4 orf 3nBg vector than those injected with the Av3nBg vector at a comparable DNA copy number per cell. This study suggests that the additional deletion of E4 in an E1 and E2a deletion background may be beneficial in decreasing immunogenicity and improving safety and toxicity profiles, as well as increasing transgene capacity and expression for liver-directed gene therapy.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Biological Psychiatry\", \"Psychiatry and Mental Health\", \"Endocrine and Autonomic Systems\", \"Endocrinology\", \"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism\"]", "language": "en", "length": [91, 0, 0], "string": "title={Hair cortisol moderates the association between obstetric complications and child wellbeing}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Leadership and Management\"]", "language": "en", "length": [45, 43, 0], "string": "title={Program Consultation by a Clinical Specialist}, container_title={JONA: The Journal of Nursing Administration}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law\", \"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment\", \"Geography, Planning and Development\", \"Building and Construction\"]", "language": "en", "length": [119, 0, 1424], "string": "title={Innovation and E-Commerce Models, the Technology Catalysts for Sustainable Development: The Emirate of Dubai Case Study}, container_title={}, abstract={Innovation and e-commerce models are essential in sustainable development globally.

both of them with seven heptagon rings. The first of them is C126 with 19 pentagons, and 39 hexagons. It is also considered C156 with 19 pentagons, and 54 hexagons. From previous work, a couple of fullerenes, C130 and C134, are mentioned for comparative reasons. These two fullerenes also contain seven heptagon rings. Fullerene C130 is constituted of 19 pentagons, and 41 hexagons. On the other hand, fullerene C134 has 19 pentagons, and 43 hexagons. Therefore, the four fullerenes considered, with seven heptagon rings, also share the property that, the number of pentagons in each of them, is 19. This fact is a consequence of a couple of equations that relates the number of pentagons, hexagons, and heptagons contained in a fullerene. Classical fullerenes contain only pentagons and hexagons, and the more familiar example is C60 with 20 hexagons, and 12 pentagons. Actually, all classical fullerenes have 12 pentagons, regardless of how many hexagons are involved. Besides this type of molecules, there exists nonclassical fullerenes, where another type of ring is presented, like squares, or heptagons. In this paper, fullerenes with 126, 130, 134, and 156 carbons are considered, with seven heptagons, and as a consequence, all them contain 19 pentagons, and they have 39, 41, 43, and 54 hexagons, respectively. Future work would focus on finding fullerenes with a different number of carbons, and hexagons, but with 7 heptagons, and 19 pentagons. Thus, fullerene C128 of this type, should contain 40 hexagons.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

It was a cross-sectional household survey undertaken in 2002. The sample contained 2849 men and women aged 20 years and above, and had a response rate of 89\u00b70 %. Factor analysis was used to identify food patterns based on a food-frequency questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to relate food patterns to anaemia. A four-factor solution explained 30\u00b75 % of the total variance. After adjusting for socio-demographic factors and four distinct food patterns, the \u2018traditional\u2019 (rice, vegetable, wheat flour), \u2018sweet tooth\u2019 (drinks, cake) and \u2018healthy\u2019 (whole grains, fruits, vegetables) patterns were independently associated with anaemia. \u2018Traditional\u2019 and \u2018sweet tooth\u2019 patterns were positively associated with anaemia, whereas the association with \u2018healthy\u2019 food pattern was negative. No association was observed between the \u2018macho\u2019 pattern (meat and alcohol) and anaemia. Compared with the lowest quartile (Q1) of the \u2018traditional\u2019 pattern, the highest quartile (Q4) had a higher risk of anaemia (men: odds ratio (OR) 2\u00b760, 95 % CI 1\u00b738, 4\u00b788; women: OR 3\u00b740, 95 % CI 2\u00b714, 5\u00b739). For the \u2018sweet tooth\u2019 pattern, compared with the lowest quartile (Q1), the OR of the highest quartile was 2\u00b734 (95 % CI 1\u00b747, 3\u00b773) for men and 2\u00b702 (95 %CI 1\u00b731, 3\u00b713) for women. The fourth quartile of healthy food was associated with a lower risk of anaemia (men: OR 0\u00b750, 95 % CI 0\u00b731, 0\u00b779; women: OR 0\u00b751, 95 % CI 0\u00b734, 0\u00b775). Women in the north had a higher risk of anaemia (OR 2\u00b749, 95 %CI 1\u00b780, 3\u00b743).

Research}, abstract={Abstract The ID (Inhibitor of DNA-binding) gene family regulates self-renewal in adult neural stem cells. Cells expressing high levels of Id1 in the neurogenic niches of the adult brain define the B1 stem cell populations and Id proteins are essential for self-renewal and the maintenance of multipotency. A decline in Id1 levels is associated with the progression to a progenitor-like cell type in which the bHLH marker Olig2 becomes highly expressed. Since the discovery of stem-like and progenitor-like cell populations within high-grade gliomas, there has been a great deal of interest in elucidating their contributions to tumorigenesis. However, analyses are complicated by the lack of reliable marker sets to definitively isolate and characterize these distinct cell lineages. Using a genetically relevant mouse model of high-grade proneural glioma, we show that high Id1 expression (Id1high) identifies self-renewing, multipotent tumor cells, while low Id1 expression (Id1low) identifies progenitor-like cells characterized by Olig2 expression and limited self-renewal capacity, thus recapitulating what is observed in the normal neurogenic niche. Id1high cells generate tumors upon orthotopic transplantation, but surprisingly, Id1low cells do so with shorter latency and higher penetrance, despite their limited self-renewal capacity. Both Id1high and Id1low cells generate tumors with high-grade features and histopathology similar to the parental tumors. Purified Id1high cells give rise to Id1low cells during tumor formation thereby possibly fueling the generation of the more tumorigenic progenitor-like population. Targeting the more progenitor-like cells via knockdown of Olig2 results in a dramatic survival benefit. These data highlight an important distinction between self-renewal capacity and tumor initiation potential, underscoring the importance of non-stem cell lineages in brain tumor disease progression.

solutions}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Aims To analyse and optimize the interobserver agreement for gross target volume (GTV) delineation on cardiac computed tomography (CCT) based on electroanatomical mapping (EAM) data acquired to guide radiotherapy for ventricular tachycardia (VT). Methods and results Electroanatomical mapping data were exported and merged with the segmented CCT using manual registration by two observers. A GTV was created by both observers for predefined left ventricular (LV) areas based on preselected endocardial EAM points indicating a two-dimensional (2D) surface area of interest. The influence of (interobserver) registration accuracy and availability of EAM data on the final GTV and 2D surface location within each LV area was evaluated. The median distance between the CCT and EAM after registration was 2.7 mm, 95th percentile 6.2 mm for observer #1 and 3.0 mm, 95th percentile 7.6 mm for observer #2 (P = 0.9). Created GTVs were significantly different (8 vs. 19 mL) with lowest GTV overlap (35%) for lateral wall target areas. Similarly, the highest shift between 2D surfaces was observed for the septal LV (6.4 mm). The optimal surface registration accuracy (2.6 mm) and interobserver agreement (\u0394 interobserver EAM surface registration 1.3 mm) was achieved if at least three cardiac chambers were mapped, including high-quality endocardial LV EAM. Conclusion Detailed EAM of at least three chambers allows for accurate co-registration of EAM data with CCT and high interobserver agreement to guide radiotherapy of VT. However, the substrate location should be taken in consideration when creating a treatment volume margin.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Education\"]", "language": "en", "length": [52, 0, 0], "string": "title={Women's health, midwifery and gynaecological nursing}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Plant Science\", \"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [95, 0, 0], "string": "title={Chromosome number evolution in the tribeBrassiceae (Brassicaceae): Evidence from isozyme number}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Software\"]", "language": "en", "length": [171, 0, 0], "string": "title={Fitting equations to data: Computer analysis of multifactor data for scientists and engineers, C.

Developing Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) Educational Videos to Improve Knowledge of Respiratory Virus Transmission and Etiquette}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract Background Most pediatric healthcare encounters for influenza-like-illness (ILI) take place in ambulatory settings where there may be multiple opportunities for transmission of respiratory viruses, yet adherence to recommended respiratory etiquette behaviors is inconsistent. We developed brief family education videos and evaluated their impact on knowledge about respiratory virus transmission and IPC practices and intention to use respiratory etiquette behaviors. Methods We developed 3 animated, 2\u20133 minute videos for waiting room display. Content included respiratory virus transmission and the use of hand hygiene, masks, and tissues in a Cover Your Cough Station (CYCS). A convenience sample of caregivers (N = 116) recruited from waiting rooms of two primary care clinics in a large pediatric care network completed a questionnaire measuring perceptions of respiratory virus transmission risk in clinics and knowledge about IPC strategies before and after viewing the videos. Clinical staff (N = 8) from participating clinics revaluated content and clarity of each video using an adapted version of The Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT). Results After viewing all videos, a significantly higher proportion of respondents knew where to find a CYCS (59%, 93%, P Conclusion Targeted educational videos may be an effective method for increasing awareness of respiratory etiquette resources in pediatric clinics to encourage the use of IPC strategies and prevent the spread of respiratory viruses.

A new model combining principal component analysis (PCA) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) is applied in order to obtain an efficiency score. To achieve a more comprehensive evaluation, a large dataset is included, but a large number of variables compared with the number of decision-making units (DMUs) may diminish the discriminatory power of DEA. To avoid this effect, we first apply PCA to separately obtain the input and output main factors. We then apply DEA to the new variables. The PCA\u2013DEA model allows us to identify 5 efficient sectors out of 42. If only DEA were applied, 16 sectors would turn out to be efficient. This shows that the model improves the discriminatory capability of DEA. Methodologically, this work contributes to the literature by proposing an efficiency measurement using a large number of inputs and outputs that could be applied in different fields.

Opponents of abortion adopted a strategy of \u201clegal but inaccessible\u201d that has resulted in the passage of more than 700 state laws since the early 1990s. Despite being a very active area of policy making, we lack a coherent explanation for the proliferation of abortion policy. Scholars studying different policies at discrete moments in time have come to conflicting conclusions about how well theories of morality policy and representation explain abortion policy. Using an original dataset comprised of a near-universe of pro- and anti-abortion rights policy from 1973 to 2013, I establish the ways in which partisan control of the government and the moral preferences of constituents shape state policy. I find that anti-abortion rights policies are well explained by both theories but that pro-abortion rights policies are not well explained as a morality policy or with descriptive representation. In addition, I show the heterogeneous effect of representation across anti-abortion rights policies; Democratic women and governors decrease the probability of only certain anti-abortion rights policies.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Sociology and Political Science\", \"Geography, Planning and Development\"]", "language": "en", "length": [44, 0, 0], "string": "title={Northern Rhodesia in the days of the Charter}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine\", \"Surgery\"]", "language": "pt", "length": [78, 0, 1514], "string": "title={Paralisia obst\u00e9trica: De quem \u00e9 a culpa?

chromosomes. The diagnosis can be established from the intra-uterine life to adulthood. TS is a chronic disease with particular morbidity and mortality. The loss to follow-up rate, during transition, between children and adult units, remains a crucial issue. This review focusses on the adolescent and young adult patients with TS. The different goals of TS transition are presented as well as some of the tools available in order to improve this transition. The involvement of the patient\u2019s family, advocacy groups and therapeutic educational programs are discussed. A specificity concerning TS transition, as compared to other chronic diseases, relies on the fact that patients with TS may present a peculiar neurocognitive profile. They are in general more anxious than the general population. Therefore, psychological support should be offered to optimize transition. Data illustrating the beneficial impact of an organised transition of TS, from paediatric units to multidisciplinary adult care systems, within the same reference centre are presented.

It contributes to heart disease, kidney issues, damaged nerves, damaged blood vessels, and blindness. Timely disease prediction can save precious lives and enable healthcare advisors to take care of the conditions. Most diabetic patients know little about the risk factors they face before diagnosis. Nowadays, hospitals deploy basic information systems, which generate vast amounts of data that cannot be converted into proper/useful information and cannot be used to support decision making for clinical purposes. There are different automated techniques available for the earlier prediction of disease. Ensemble learning is a data analysis technique that combines multiple techniques into a single optimal predictive system to evaluate bias and variation, and to improve predictions. Diabetes data, which included 17 variables, were gathered from the UCI repository of various datasets. The predictive models used in this study include AdaBoost, Bagging, and Random Forest, to compare the precision, recall, classification accuracy, and F1-score.

governance effectiveness and explain why the same rules often result in not the same norms. Design/methodology/approach The author proposes a \u201ccorporate governance culture\u201d concept explaining the differences within corporate governance institutions and making it possible to measure their effectiveness. Based on a literature review that included 186 research studies published in the corporate governance field, the author found that most (160) concern structural numerical variables. Only 26 refer to behavioural and cultural issues, and they support the idea of an interdisciplinary approach to governance problems. Findings A significant contribution of this paper is that it proposes an integrative framework that operationalises psychological, sociological and philosophical issues that influence corporate governance mechanisms. The proposed concept can reanimate the debate about the need for tight governance regulations or leaving room for a loose governance regime. Originality/value The idea of \u201ccorporate governance culture\u201d explains the divergences identified in studies on corporate governance mechanisms, pointing out behavioural and cultural issues as crucial aspects of governance bodies.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0,

2018, the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2) updated the original definition of sarcopenia, establishing new criteria to be used globally. Early diagnosis of sarcopenia in nursing home residents and the identification of contributing factors would target interventions to reduce the incidence of malnutrition, social isolation, functional decline, hospitalization and mortality. Aim Verify the prevalence and the degree of severity of sarcopenia according to the new EWSGOP2 criteria and to analyse its associated factors in residents living in nursing homes in Central Catalonia (Spain). Design A cross-sectional multicenter study was conducted in 4 nursing homes. SARC-F test was applied as the initial screening, muscle strength was measured by a dynamometer, skeletal muscle mass by bioimpedance analysis and physical performance by Gait Speed. Four categories were used: total probable sarcopenia, probable sarcopenia, confirmed sarcopenia and severe sarcopenia. Results Among the total sample of 104 nursing home residents (mean age 84.6, \u00b1 7.8; median 86, IQR 110), 84.6% were women and 85 (81.7%) (95% confidence interval [CI] 73.0-88.0) had total probable sarcopenia, 63 (60.5%) had probable sarcopenia, 19 (18.3%) had confirmed sarcopenia and 7 (6.7%) had severe sarcopenia. In the bivariate analysis, obesity was negatively associated and total time in sedentary behavior positively associated with all sarcopenia categories. In addition, malnutrition and urinary continence were positively associated with total and probable sarcopenia. Urinary incontinence was a positive associated factor of total and probable sarcopenia. In the multivariate analysis, obesity represented a negative associated factor: OR = 0.13 (0.03 - 0.57), p = 0.007 and OR = 0.14 (0.03 - 0.60), p = 0.008 with total and probable sarcopenia, respectively, adjusted by urinary incontinence status. For confirmed sarcopenia, obesity also represented a negative associated factor OR = 0.06 (0.01 - 0.99), p = 0.049 and the total time in sedentary behavior a positive associated factor OR = 1.10 (1.00- 1.20), p = 0.040. Conclusions According the EWGSOP2 criteria, high prevalence of sarcopenia was found in institutionalized older people, ranging from 6.7 to 81.7% depending on the category. Malnutrition, urinary incontinence and total time in sedentary behavior were associated with sarcopenia, whilst obesity represented a protective factor in this population.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0,

most common of the primary immune defects of man. While these defects have been described in clinical terms for more than five decades, in most cases, the pathogenesis is still poorly understood. The most common clinically important of these is common variable immune deficiency. However there is no strict definition of this defect and the criteria for initiating immune globulin therapy are not standardized, leading to wide variation in treatment practices. In addition there has been no clear means to adequate assess progression of lung disease or elucidate the causes of progressive pulmonary inflammation found in some subjects. Moreover, there are still questions such as what are the best predictors of chronic lung disease and how can we prevent this disorder. Other complications such as autoimmunity, granulomatous disease, gastrointestinal inflation, are similarly poorly understood although treatment with various biological agents has been used with some success. A few bio-markers for assessing clinical and immunologic status have been proposed, and some have proved to be useful, but additional methods to gauge the benefits of therapy, predict outcomes, and harmonize treatment practices are needed. Aside from Ig replacement, additional means of prevention of lung disease may need consideration to reduce lung damage apart from prophylactic antibiotics. These might include using macrolides as anti-inflammatory agents, inhaled corticosteroids, bronchodilators, mucolytics or mechanical or rehabilitative respiratory methods.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0,

abstract={Abstract Background Preterm delivery rate is a crucial public health indicator, yet reliable statistic is currently not available in China. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to review studies on preterm delivery rate in China, explore sources of heterogeneity, and estimate the preterm delivery rate in China. Methods Published studies on preterm delivery rate in China since 2010 were electronically searched from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Science and Technology Journal Database, and Wanfang Database, and complemented by manual search. Study selection, data extraction, and quality and bias assessment (using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist) were conducted by two reviewers independently. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed to estimate the pooled preterm delivery rate, and prespecified stratified analysis was conducted to explore sources of heterogeneity. Results The database search returned 4494 articles and manual search identified 10 additional studies. In total, 162 studies were eligible, of which 124 were hospital-based and 38 population-based. The pooled preterm delivery rate of hospital-based studies (7.2%; 95% CI: 6.9% to 7.6%) was significantly higher than that of population-based studies (4.9%; 95% CI: 4.5% to 5.4%) (P for subgroup difference P for subgroup difference = 0.07): 5.3% for Eastern, 4.6% for Central, and 3.8% for Western. Conclusions According to population-based studies, the preterm delivery rate in China is around 5%. This rate is substantially lower than estimates from hospital-based studies or estimates from a combination of both hospital-based and population-based studies as having been done in previous studies.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

This data set can be derived from the differential ages of the passively evolving galaxies. Meanwhile, the [Formula: see text]-parameter, which describes the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) peak, and the newly measured value of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) shift parameter [Formula: see text] are used to present combinational constraints on the same cosmology. The combinational constraints favor an accelerating flat universe while the flat \u039bCDM cosmology is also analyzed in the same way. We obtain a result compatible with that by many other independent cosmological observations.

Thalidomide (\u03b1-N-[phthalimido] glutarimide, C 13 H 10 N 2 O 4), a glutamic acid derivative, has proved useful in the treatment of both newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory MM, however, its potential for teratogenicity lays a huge burden on its use as a therapeutic agent. Ongoing efforts have been directed towards development of analogues, which retain anti-MM activity without teratogenic effects. A product of cytochrome P450 2C19 isozyme biotransformation of thalidomide, 5\u2032-OH-thalidomide, has been shown to be partly responsible for the anti-angiogenic effect of thalidomide. Based on the structure of this metabolite several N-substituted and tetraflourinated thalidomide analogues have been synthesized as potential anti-angiogenic agents and have shown pre-clinical activity in prostate cancer. In this study, we demonstrate potent anti-MM activity and delineate potential mechanisms of two such compounds, CPS11 (an N-substituted thalidomide) and CPS49 (a tetraflourinated thalidomide). Both CPS11 and CPS49 showed inhibition of proliferation of several MM cell lines as well as primary tumor cells from relapsed/refractory MM patients. These drugs had significant activity in myeloma cell lines resistant to conventional chemotherapy agents (dexamethasone, adriamycin, mitoxantrone and melphalan). Both the drugs were able to overcome the protective effects of growth factors like IL-6, IGF-1, and VEGF, and co-culture with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), demonstrating their activity against myeloma cells in conditions simulating the natural microenvironment. In most of the cytotoxicity experiments, CPS49 was more potent compared to CPS11. An additive cytotoxic effect was noted when these agents were combined with dexamethasone and melphalan. Apoptosis was noted in MM1.S cells as evidenced by annexin and PI staining and a time- and dose-dependent increase in cleavage of poly ADP-ribosepolymerase (PARP) and caspase-8. Additionally, Z-VAD-FMK partially blocked these effects. Importantly, apoptosis triggered by these drugs was associated with down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins like Mcl1 and XIAP. In matrigel based angiogenesis assays both drugs demonstrated anti-angiogenic activity, CPS49 being more potent than CPS11. To further delineate their molecular mechanism of actions, we evaluated the effect of these drugs on various intracellular signaling pathways known to be important in myeloma. Both the drugs were able inhibit the PI3K/Akt and JAK/STAT pathways in MM1.S myeloma cells line. These encouraging in vitro data will provide the platform for testing these analogues initially in animal models and subsequently in the clinic.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Colloid and Surface Chemistry\", \"Biochemistry\", \"Catalysis\"]", "language": "en", "length": [78, 0, 0], "string": "title={The Ionization Constant of Sulfamic Acid from Electromotive Force Measurements}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Ocean Engineering\", \"Water Science and Technology\", \"Civil and Structural Engineering\"]", "language": "en", "length": [104, 41, 1763], "string": "title={Triton Field Trials: Promoting Consistent Environmental Monitoring Methodologies for Marine Energy Sites}, container_title={Journal of Marine Science and Engineering}, abstract={Uncertainty surrounding the potential environmental impacts of marine energy (ME) has resulted in extensive and expensive environmental monitoring requirements for ME deployments.

Thirteen potential field sites were assessed to determine suitable locations for testing the performance of relevant monitoring technologies. This introductory paper provides an overview of how priority research areas and associated promising technologies were identified as well as how testing locations were identified for TFiT activities. Through these scoping efforts, TFiT focused on four activity areas: collision risk, underwater noise, electromagnetic fields, and changes in habitat. Technologies and methodologies were tested at field sites in Alaska, Washington, California, and New Hampshire. Detailed information on the effectiveness of the identified methodologies and specific recommendations for each of the four focus areas are included in the companion papers in this Special Issue.}",

abstract={AbstractMisfolding and aggregation of proteins is strongly linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, but how such species bring about their cytotoxic actions remains poorly understood. Here we used specifically-designed optical reporter probes and live fluorescence imaging in primary hippocampal neurons to characterise the mechanism by which prefibrillar, oligomeric forms of the Alzheimer\u2019s-associated peptide, A\u03b242, exert their detrimental effects. We used a pH-sensitive reporter, A\u03b242-CypHer, to track A\u03b2 internalisation in real-time, demonstrating that oligomers are rapidly taken up into cells in a dynamin-dependent manner, and trafficked via the endo-lysosomal pathway resulting in accumulation in lysosomes. In contrast, a non-assembling variant of A\u03b242 (vA\u03b242) assayed in the same way is not internalised. Tracking ovalbumin uptake into cells using CypHer or Alexa Fluor tags shows that preincubation with A\u03b242 disrupts protein uptake. Our results identify a potential mechanism by which amyloidogenic aggregates impair cellular function through disruption of the endosomal\u2013lysosomal pathway.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0,

Legal Information Website}, container_title={}, abstract={Information and Communication Technology in general and the internet in particular have been creating unprecedented opportunities in facilitating and streamlining access to information. Websites have become a common way of publishing legal information for the public in many countries. In Ethiopia, however, the availability of legal websites has been very limited or non-existent. Except for the constitution, no other basic Ethiopian law has ever been published online. To benefit from the tremendous potentials of the internet, a project was initiated to develop an Ethiopian Legal Information Web Site.Based on users' requirements obtained from questionnaire analysis, and current paradigms and implications, the Ethiopian Legal Information Website was designed, developed, implemented and maintained. The website is an online database of Ethiopian basic laws developed by Mekelle University, Ethiopia, in cooperation with the Non-Western Law Department of Ghent University, Belgium.Basic laws included on the site at present are the Ethiopian Constitution, Civil Code, Criminal Code, Civil Procedure Code, Criminal Procedure Code, Commercial Code and Family Code. The laws can be viewed and used in full text html, whereas some of the laws including the 2004 Criminal Code, Family Code, FDKE Constitution and the Tigray Regional State Constitution are available in pdf Laws can be searched by keywords using the site search engine. Comments and suggestions from experts and Ethiopian laws users have been collected, hence modifications, improvements and additions have been made to the website. The Ethiopian Legal Information Website was first hosted on the University of Ghent internet server and currently in the Mekelle University server at http://mail.mu.edu. et/~ethiopialaws/.1 The Ethiopian Legal Information Website has been found to be a useful web portal to access and use the basic Ethiopian laws. The University of Ghent, ILO, the Library of Congress, AUSTLII, WASHLAW, WIKIPEDIA and other major legal web portals make citations in reference to the site. While the website currently contains only the basic laws of the federal government, an action plan is prepared to include regional laws of Ethiopia. Other legal information including amendments to the laws, decisions and legal news will also be included on the site, hence a comprehensive Ethiopian Legal Web Portal will be developed and maintained.

A major bottleneck regarding the efforts to better quantify greenhouse gas fluxes, map sources and sinks, and understand flux regulation is the shortage of low-cost and accurate-enough measurement methods. The studies of methane (CH4) \u2013 a long-lived greenhouse gas increasing rapidly but irregularly in the atmosphere for unclear reasons, and with poorly understood source\u2013sink attribution \u2013 suffer from such method limitations. This study presents new calibration and data processing approaches for use of a low-cost CH4 sensor in flux chambers. Results show that the change in relative CH4 levels can be determined at rather high accuracy in the 2\u2013700 ppm mole fraction range, with modest efforts of collecting reference samples in situ and without continuous access to expensive reference instruments. This opens possibilities for more affordable and time-effective measurements of CH4 in flux chambers. To facilitate such measurements, we also provide a description for building and using an Arduino logger for CH4, carbon dioxide (CO2), relative humidity, and temperature.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0,

Thus, the aim of this paper was conduct an extensive literature review to develop a conceptual model to depict the proposed impact of social media marketing on commercial bank customers\u2019 behaviour from a Social Exchange Theory (SET) perspective. Through an extensive review and synthesis of the literature on SMM, the researchers were able to theoretically postulate and propose the (possible) influence of the SET determinants inherent in SMM on commercial bank customers\u2019 satisfaction, loyalty and their repurchase intentions. It is recommended that bank managers and marketers take cognizance of these (possible) proposed relationships, more specifically, the influence of the SET determinants inherent in SMM on bank customers\u2019 behaviour.

abstract={Abstract Background BPI-9016M is a novel small-molecule inhibitor that simultaneously targets both c-Met and AXL tyrosine kinases. This phase I study aimed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of BPI-9016M in Chinese patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods Over the dose range of 100 mg to 800 mg, eligible patients were administered with a single dose of 9016M tablet and received 7 days of pharmacokinetics evaluation, followed by continuous dose administration (QD dosing, 28 days). Standard \u201c3 + 3\u201d dose escalations were performed. Results Twenty NSCLC patients were treated. All patients experienced at least one adverse event (AE), of which treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported in 17 (85.0%) patients. The most common TRAEs were alanine transaminase (ALT) elevation (60%), bilirubin increased (40%), dysgeusia (40%), constipation (30%), hypertension (25%), and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (15%). The TRAEs of grade 3 or higher during treatment were hypertension (15%), pulmonary embolism (5%), and laryngeal pain (5%). No dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed, and the MTD was not reached. The median time to Cmax ranged from 2.0 to 3.5 h, and the plasma concentration of BPI-9016M declined rapidly after Tmax fitting a single-compartment model. The mean AUC0\u201372 h of M1 and M2-2, main metabolites of BPI-9016M, were 4.8\u20136.6 folds and 4.1\u20139.8 folds higher than that of BPI-9016M, respectively. Exposure to BPI-9016M, M1, and M2-2 reached moderate saturation at 600 mg. Among 19 evaluable patients, 1 had a partial response and 10 patients had stable disease. Conclusion BPI-9016M showed favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profiles, and no DLT was observed at doses up to 800 mg once daily. The promising antitumor activity in Chinese NSCLC patients supports further development of this tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

Therefore, the regulatory sequence of the gene will provide clues on cardiomyocyte differentiation and atrial specific transcription regulation. Here we report the identification of the murine genomic sequence of the MLC-2a gene (Mylc2a). The entire 5\u2032 flanking region was identified and sequenced. In addition, the exon-intron boundaries and 3\u2032 flanking region were determined. Sequence comparison revealed the presence of the final exon (11) of the mouse glucokinase gene on chromosome 11, 2.0 kb upstream of the Mylc2a transcription start site. In addition, we compared the structure of the gene to other myosin light chains to show evolutionary conservation. The intron-exon boundaries turned out to be highly conserved and an increasing intron size in more complex mammalian species was found.

HEV is a non-enveloped virus, which circulates in the blood in a quasi-enveloped form. The quasi-envelope protects HEV particles from neutralising anti-capsid antibodies in the serum; however, most vaccine approaches are designed to induce an immune response against the HEV capsid. In this study, we explored systemic in vivo administration of a novel synthetic and myotropic Adeno-associated virus vector (AAVMYO3) to express the small HEV phosphoprotein ORF3 (found on quasi-enveloped HEV) in the musculature of mice, resulting in the robust and dose-dependent formation of anti-ORF3 antibodies. Neutralisation assays using the serum of ORF3 AAV-transduced mice showed a modest inhibitory effect on the infection of quasi-enveloped HEV in vivo, comparable to previously characterised anti-ORF3 antibodies used as a control. The novel AAVMYO3 capsid used in this study can serve as a versatile platform for the continued development of vector-based vaccines against HEV and other infectious agents, which could complement traditional vaccines akin to the current positive experience with SARS-CoV-2.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

The use of geospatial technology in disaster management is a natural fit because almost every aspect of a disaster is referenced by location. This paper presents the results of a recent web-based survey of disaster management practitioners. Findings reveal that more than 60% of disaster management practitioners are currently using geospatial technology and 70% plan to use it in a future disaster management activity. However, the results indicate that most disaster management practitioners have a low level of knowledge of geospatial technology. The survey findings also show that geospatial technologies enhance situational awareness, cost is a major challenge for practitioners who would like to use them, and an opportunity exists for the academic community to engage with practitioners to help them raise their level of geospatial knowledge.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Linguistics and Language\", \"Developmental and Educational Psychology\", \"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology\", \"Language and Linguistics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [91, 0, 1175], "string": "title={How does comprehension of passives develop?

Actional passives were understood better than experientials, with no difference among the subcategories of experiential verbs, and no effect of verb frequency or regularity. Response distributions for each verb type did not show two populations of subjects \u2013 one knowing and the other not knowing the passive \u2013 but approximately unimodal distributions whose mean increased with age. Experiment II studied preschoolers. Again, the actional passives were systematically easier than the experientials, and again, for neither verb type did the response distributions show two distinct subject populations, one competent and the other incompetent. The forms of the distributions cannot be wholly accounted for by fluctuating attention to cues to passivization, but indicate that many children have partial knowledge of the passive (increasing with age). A hypothesis about the nature of this partial knowledge accounts for the gradual acquisition and the difference between the verb types.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Gynecologic melanomas are extremely rare malignancies, and primary malignant melanoma of the cervix (PMMC) is the rarest among them all, with less than 100 cases reported so far. Although some conditions have been correlated with the pathogenesis of this entity, no specific risk factor has been yet identified, with vaginal bleeding being the most common symptoms. The diagnosis is based on physical examination with speculum assessment and cytologic and histopathologic findings accompanied with immunohistochemical staining of lesion\u2019s biopsies. Case Presentation. We report a case of PMMC in a 34-year-old para-2 patient, among the youngest cases of PMMC reported, that presented to our clinic for routine examination. Gynecologic examination demonstrated a dark, heavily fully pigmented cervical growth completely covering the entire external cervical os. Biopsy obtained and showed malignant melanoma. She underwent radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. The pathological diagnosis was FIGO stage IB1 PMMC. Despite 2 courses of anti-PD-1 antibody (Nivolumab) treatment, the patient passed away 13 months after diagnosis (12 months after surgery). Conclusions. Early diagnosis and subsequently early treatment are of high importance regarding patients\u2019 prognosis and survival. No standardized protocols or treatment guidelines specific for this rare cancer have been issued; thus, clinicians are called to assess each case individually. Current treatment options are based on surgical excision mostly with radical hysterectomy, but in advanced or recurrent state of the disease, other treatment modalities, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy, can be employed. Prognosis for these patients is very poor, and survival rate remains extremely low, with the median OS reported being less than 2 years. Reporting and publishing of such cases are both of paramount importance for the better understanding of this uncommon cervical malignancy, and further biological and clinical investigations are required for more suitable and effective therapies to be determined. A new staging system, specific to PMMC, could be of great use for the better correlation of the disease\u2019s stage and prognosis of these patients.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

can develop after uterine instrumentation. The increased risks of vascular changes, including abnormal placentation, after repeated cesarean sections are well studied. Herein, we describe a patient with delayed hemorrhage from a uterine AVM, following dilation and curettage for a cesarean scar pregnancy. Case: A 32-year-old G3P2 presented with a cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy managed with dilation and curettage, which incurred a 1,500-ml blood loss. Within 6 weeks, she returned with 2 episodes of vaginal bleeding. Initial angiography demonstrated a high-flow arteriovenous fistula, which was coiled. Vaginal hemorrhage recurred; repeat angiography demonstrated a large AVM. Gelfoam embolization of the bilateral internal iliac arteries reduced the vascularity of the AVM. The AVM's location, starting at the left lateral apex of the cesarean scar and extending into the parametrium, necessitated a radical hysterectomy. Pathologic examination revealed a placenta percreta extending into the parametrium. Conclusion: The prevalence of uterine AVMs has increased with the rise in surgical obstetrics. In patients with a failed prior interventional procedure, surgical management is necessary to prevent life-threatening hemorrhage. The location of the AVM within the abnormal uterine scar tissue requires familiarity with radical pelvic surgical techniques that are normally used in cancer surgery in order to definitively treat this delayed obstetrical complication.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Cancer Research\", \"Oncology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [63, 0, 0], "string": "title={Treatment of oral Kaposi sarcoma with intralesional vinblastine}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Behavioral Neuroscience\", \"Physiology\", \"Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [53, 0, 365], "string": "title={The Bayesian brain: What is it and do humans have it?}, container_title={}, abstract={Abstract It has been widely asserted that humans have a \u201cBayesian brain.\u201d Surprisingly, however, this term has never been defined and appears to be used differently by different authors.

lateral parabrachial nucleus in the control of sodium appetite}, container_title={}, abstract={In states of sodium deficiency many animals seek and consume salty solutions to restore body fluid homeostasis. These behaviors reflect the presence of sodium appetite that is a manifestation of a pattern of central nervous system (CNS) activity with facilitatory and inhibitory components that are affected by several neurohumoral factors. The primary focus of this review is on one structure in this central system, the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN). However, before turning to a more detailed discussion of the LPBN, a brief overview of body fluid balance-related body-to-brain signaling and the identification of the primary CNS structures and humoral factors involved in the control of sodium appetite is necessary. Angiotensin II, mineralocorticoids, and extracellular osmotic changes act on forebrain areas to facilitate sodium appetite and thirst. In the hindbrain, the LPBN functions as a key integrative node with an ascending output that exerts inhibitory influences on forebrain regions. A nonspecific or general deactivation of LPBN-associated inhibition by GABA or opioid agonists produces NaCl intake in euhydrated rats without any other treatment. Selective LPBN manipulation of other neurotransmitter systems [e.g., serotonin, cholecystokinin (CCK), corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), glutamate, ATP, or norepinephrine] greatly enhances NaCl intake when accompanied by additional treatments that induce either thirst or sodium appetite. The LPBN interacts with key forebrain areas that include the subfornical organ and central amygdala to determine sodium intake. To summarize, a model of LPBN inhibitory actions on forebrain facilitatory components for the control of sodium appetite is presented in this review.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Methods: We report a case presentation of a patient with keratouveitis. Results: A 70-year-old woman suffered from accidental ocular contact with E. grandicornis sap in her left eye. Two hours after the contact, she attended the clinic due to conjunctival hyperemia and pain. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/25. The toxic conjunctivitis was treated with topical lubricant and steroid. After 24 h, she presented blurred vision. BCVA was 20/80. Toxic keratouveitis was diagnosed. Topical treatment with 1% cyclopentolate t.i.d., 5% sodium chloride, 1.14% dexamethasone phosphate each hour, and 4% sodium hyaluronate each hour was continued. Complete resolution was obtained 1 week later. Euphorbia sap content analysis was performed using dissolvent extraction spectrophotometry. Its contents included flavonoids, alkaloids, phenols and sesquiterpene lactones. Conclusion: Corneal exposure to E. grandicornis sap is a cause of nonvisually threatening keratouveitis when adequately treated with corticosteroids.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

container_title={G\u00e9otechnique}, abstract={This paper presents a study of the micromechanical behaviour of crushable soils. For a single grain loaded diametrically between flat platens, data are presented for the tensile strengths of particles of different size and mineralogy. These data are shown to be consistent with Weibull statistics of brittle fracture. Triaxial tests on different soils of equal relative density show that the dilatational component of internal angle of friction reduces logarithmically with mean effective stress normalized by grain tensile strength. The tensile strength of grains is also shown to govern normal compression. For a sample of uniform grains under uniaxial compression, the yield stress is related to the average grain tensile strength. If particles fracture such that the smallest particles are in geometrically self-similar configurations under increasing geotoscopic stress, with a constant probability of fracture, a fractal geometry evolves with the successive fracture of the smallest grains, in agreement with the available data. A new work equation predicts that the evolution of a fractal geometry gives rise to a linear compression line when voids ratio is plotted against the logarithm of geotoscopic stress, in agreement with published data.

factor method of standard EN ISO 13790:2008 to take account of a number of important features of air-conditioning systems that are currently ignored. In all other respects it is compatible with this method, which is the most widely used means of producing building Energy Performance Certificates in Europe. In particular it enables the impact of free cooling, and of the tempering of supply air to be quantified; calculates tailored seasonal efficiency figures for chillers, and provides initial estimates of the potential savings of inter-room heat recovery and of the energy penalties associated with terminal reheat and dual duct systems. Practical application: This paper proposes an extension to the most widely used calculation method for Energy Performance Certificates in Europe, improving its ability to reflect important features of central air-conditioning systems. This is of particular importance for climates and buildings where cooling is required when the outdoor air temperature is relatively low. In particular it enables the impact of free cooling, and of the tempering of supply air to be quantified, calculates tailored seasonal efficiency figures for chillers, and provides initial estimates of the potential savings of inter-room heat recovery and of the energy penalties associated with some other systems.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Internal Medicine\"]", "language": "en", "length": [110, 0, 0], "string": "title={Challenges faced by musculoskeletal health research in Australia and New Zealand due to the COVID \u201019 pandemic}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Inorganic Chemistry\", \"Physical and Theoretical Chemistry\"]", "language": "en", "length": [102, 0, 0], "string": "title={Bridge addition compounds.

The gelatinolytic activities were compared with parallel cell dUTP incorporation in the ischemic zones of adjacent sections. In the brain, the integrated density of MMP-2 increased significantly by 1 hour after MCAO and was persistently elevated thereafter. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression was highly correlated with the extent of neuron injury and the number of injured neurons (r = 0.9763, SE = 0.004, 2 P}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

development and optimization has been largely through experimental exploration. While there have been many efforts to develop computational tools to guide rational antibody engineering, most approaches are of limited accuracy when applied to antibody design, and have largely been limited to analysing a single point mutation at a time. To overcome this gap, we have curated a dataset of 242 experimentally determined changes in binding affinity upon multiple point mutations in antibody-target complexes (89 increasing and 153 decreasing binding affinity). Here, we have shown that by using our graph-based signatures and atomic interaction information, we can accurately analyse the consequence of multi-point mutations on antigen binding affinity. Our approach outperformed other available tools across cross-validation and two independent blind tests, achieving Pearson's correlations of up to 0.95. We have implemented our new approach, mmCSM-AB, as a web-server that can help guide the process of affinity maturation in antibody design. mmCSM-AB is freely available at

dysfunctions. Stroboscopic vision (SV) training has been deemed to enhance somatosensorial pathways in this population group; nevertheless, until recently no studies have addressed the additional effects of this treatment option to the traditional therapeutic approach. Methods: To evaluate the effectiveness of a partial visual deprivation training protocol in patients with CAI, a randomized controlled trial was carried out. Patients with CAI (n = 73) were randomized into either a balance training, SV training, or a control (no training) group. For participants assigned into training groups, they received 18 training sessions over 6 weeks. The primary outcome was dynamic balance as measured by the Star Excursion Balance Test assessed at baseline and after 6 weeks of intervention. Secondary outcome measures included ankle dorsiflexion range of motion, self-reported instability feeling, and ankle functional status. Results: Better scores in stroboscopic training and balance training groups in all outcome measures were observed in comparison with the control group with moderate to large effect sizes. Stroboscopic training was more effective than neuromuscular training in self-reported instability feeling (cohen\u2019s d = 0.71; p = 0.042) and anterior reach distance of the star excursion balance test (cohen\u2019s d = 1.23; p = 0.001).

Many studies have been devoted to the feature extraction and isolation mechanisms of various faults. However, limited efforts have been spent on the optimization of sensor location in a complex engineering system, which is expected to be a critical step for the successful application of fault diagnostics. In this paper, a novel sensor location approach is proposed for the purpose of fault isolation using population-based incremental learning (PBIL). A directed graph is used to model the fault propagation of a complex engineering system. The multidimensional causal relationships of faults and symptoms were obtained via traversing the directed path in the directed graph. To locate the minimal quantity of sensors for desired fault isolatability, the problem of sensor location was firstly formulated as an optimization problem and then handled using PBIL. Two classical cases, including a diesel engine and a fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU), were taken as examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results show that the proposed method can minimize the quantity of sensors while keeping the capacity of fault isolation unchanged.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Here, we focus on the particular case of breeding blind hens for commercial egg-laying systems, in order to benefit their welfare. Many people find breeding blind hens intuitively repellent, yet 'welfare-only' positions appear to be committed to endorsing this possibility if it produces welfare gains. We call this the 'Blind Hens' Challenge'. In this paper, we argue that there are both empirical and theoretical reasons why even those adopting 'welfare-only' views should be concerned about breeding blind hens. But we also argue that alternative views, which (for example) claim that it is important to respect the telos or rights of an animal, do not offer a more convincing solution to questions raised by the possibility of disenhancing animals for their own benefit.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Transformation\u201d or \u201cRegulation Capture\u201d\u2014Research on the Interactive Mechanism between Environmental Regulation and Green Transformation of Dairy Farming Subject Production}, container_title={International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health}, abstract={Under the situation of an increasing resource and environment shortage, the green transformation of dairy farming subject production driven by environmental regulation is the concentrated embodiment of a \u201cpromising government\u201d to solve the problem of breeding environmental pollution. Due to the shortcomings of environmental regulation itself and the undefined connotation of the green transformation of dairy farming subject production, the interactive relationship between the two remains unclear at present. Based on defining the concept of green transformation of dairy farming subject production, this paper aims to analyze the interactive mechanism between the environmental regulation and green transformation of dairy farming main production, build a dynamic game model between the environmental regulators and dairy farming subject, and introduce the constraints and benefits of a reputation mechanism on the behavior in the model to explore whether environmental regulation can drive the green transformation of dairy farming subject production. The results showed that the green transformation of dairy farming subject production followed the \u201csubject substitution view\u201d and emphasized \u201csource reduction, process control and terminal treatment\u201d. Strictly designed environmental regulations could effectively drive the green transformation of dairy farming subject production, but it was inevitable that the environmental regulators were vulnerable to the rent-seeking behavior of dairy farming subjects, which was \u201cregulation capture\u201d. The introduction of the reputation mechanism has greatly improved the rent-seeking behavior of dairy farming subjects and the probability that environmental regulators have \u201cregulation capture\u201d, indirectly forcing dairy farming subjects to participate in the green transformation of production. The greater the punishment for dairy farming subjects who do not participate in the green transformation of production was, the more they can be forced to participate in the green transformation of production. At the same time, it also reduces the risk of damage to the credibility of the government. Based on the studies above, this paper also further discussed the shortcomings of environmental regulation itself, including the \u201cre exit and light implementation\u201d of the environmental regulation policy, \u201cdecentralization and light inspection\u201d of the environmental regulation subject, \u201cresult and light process\u201d of the environmental regulation mode, and \u201cformal regulation and light informal regulation\u201d of the environmental regulation form, which provides a scientific reference for the formulation of the environmental regulation policy of livestock and poultry breeding in the future. Compared with previous studies, this paper is innovative in two aspects: first, it defines the conceptual connotation of a green transformation of dairy farming subject production, and second, it systematically discusses the interaction mechanism between the environmental regulation and green transformation of dairy farming subject production. This paper provides a scientific reference for the development of future environmental regulation policies for livestock and poultry farming.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

A cross-sectional sample of the Iranian infertile men}, container_title={Basic and Clinical Andrology}, abstract={Abstract Background Recent studies suggest that serum vitamin D may be associated with semen parameters. In the present cross-sectional study, we attempted to investigate the association between serum vitamin D levels and semen parameters among Iranian sub-fertile men. Results A total of 350 infertile men recruited for this cross-sectional study using a simple random sampling method with a mean age of 34.77 years old, body mass index of 26.67 kg/m2, serum vitamin D of 20.17 ng/ml, semen volume of 3.82 mL, sperm count of 44.48 (106/mL), sperm total motility of 38.10 %, and morphologically normal sperm of 7.0 %. After controlling for potential confounders, serum vitamin D was positively associated with semen volume (\u03b2 = 0.63, 95 % CI: 0.06, 1.20), sperm count (\u03b2 = 14.40, 95 % CI: 4.56, 24.25), sperm total motility (\u03b2 = 18.12, 95 % CI: 12.37, 23.86), and sperm normal morphology (\u03b2 = 1.95, 95 % CI: 1.07, 2.83). Conclusions The present findings suggest that higher serum vitamin D levels are positively associated with higher semen volume, sperm count, sperm total motility, and normal morphology rate. These findings, however, do not specify a cause-and-effect relationship, and there is a need for further research in this area to understand whether vitamin D supplementation can improve semen parameters.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Toxicology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [174, 0, 0], "string": "title={Human health risk and hydro-geochemical appraisal of groundwater in the southwest part of Bangladesh using GIS, water quality indices, and multivariate statistical approaches}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Soil Science\", \"Agronomy and Crop Science\", \"Microbiology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [83, 0, 0], "string": "title={Arbuscular mycorrhizas modify tomato responses to soil zinc and phosphorus addition}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)\", \"Cultural Studies\"]", "language": "en", "length": [232, 0, 0], "string": "title={Polish Literature and National Identity: A Postcolonial Perspective.

propose a solution to the problem of a lack of machine processable semantics in business process management.Design/methodology/approachThe paper introduces a methodology that combines domain and company\u2010specific ontologies and databases to obtain multiple levels of abstraction for process mining and analysis. The authors valuated this approach with a real case study from the apparel domain, using a prototype system and techniques developed in the Process Mining Framework (ProM). The results of this approach are compared with similar research.FindingsSemantically enriching process execution data can successfully raise analysis from the syntactic to the semantic level, and enable multiple perspectives of analysis on business processes. Combining this approach with complementary research in semantic business process management (SBPM) can provide results comparable to multidimensional analysis in data warehouse and on line analytical processing (OLAP) technologies.Originality/valueThe approach and prototype described in this paper improve the richness of semantics available for open\u2010source process mining and analysis tools like ProM, and the richness and detail of the resulting analysis.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

provision influences reproductive success in breeding blue fox vixens: a preliminary study}, container_title={}, abstract={AbstractThe aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of an unfamiliar nest and environmental enrichment, ie provision of an additional nest, on farmed blue fox (Alopex lagopus) vixens\u2019 reproductive performance. Two experimental groups were evaluated in the study: i) a single nest (SN) group where vixens had an unfamiliar top nest only, and ii) a group with two nests (TN), an unfamiliar top nest and a familiar floor nest. Since reproductive performance is typically lower in young blue fox vixens, half of the experimental animals consisted of primiparous vixens, to examine whether an unfamiliar and an additional nest affected primiparous and multiparous vixens\u2019 reproduction differently. No significant differences were found in reproductive performance between the experimental groups or between the primiparous and the multiparous vixens with the number of weaned cubs per inseminated vixen 4.8 (\u00b1 4.0) and 4.9 (\u00b1 4.5) for the primiparous and 5.6 (\u00b1 4.9) and 5.5 (\u00b1 4.6) for the multiparous vixens in SN and TN groups, respectively. In the multiparous vixens, the cub losses were higher in SN than in TN groups. The higher cub loss in the SN group may have been due to the lack of a familiar nest. In the TN group, where vixens had the opportunity to choose between two nest types, the majority (86%) of the primiparous vixens whelped in the floor nest, whereas the majority (73%) of the multiparous vixens favoured the unfamiliar top nest for whelping. Both nests were used by 43% of all TN vixens, a finding that indicates that an additional nest may have an enrichment value for blue fox vixens. The potential welfare consequences of providing blue fox vixens with an additional nest box should be investigated in future studies.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

abstract={Background. Plasma creatinine (Pcr) levels at birth are greatly elevated in relation to the size (and the muscle mass) of the newborn infant and remain so for 1 to 2 weeks. Particularly intriguing is the fact that Pcr levels are higher in preterm than in term infants and for a longer postnatal period. The smaller the birth weight, the higher the Pcr. This cannot be explained by maternal transfer of Pcr or by the absolute and relative (to adult body surface area) reduced glomerular filtration rate of the newborn. Perhaps the renal handling of creatinine is involved. Design. In 522 pairs of mothers and fetuses, maternal and fetal Pcr were compared from 16 weeks of gestation until term. Pcr was measured in 66 newborns of various birth weights and followed for 1 month. Creatinine clearance (Ccr) and inulin clearance (Cin) were measured simultaneously in adult (n = 8) and newborn (n = 20) New Zealand White rabbits. In the latter, nephrogenesis continues after birth and they are therefore a good animal model for the study of the renal function in premature infants. Patient. A case of a premature male infant is presented (gestation: 29 weeks; birth weight: 1410 g) suspected of having sepsis because of premature rupture of membranes and postpartum maternal fever. This suspicion was not confirmed. Blood chemistry evaluation showed a high Pcr at birth (0.85 mg/dL, 75 \u03bcmol/L), even higher than that of the mother (0.77 mg/dL, 68 \u03bcmol/L). The Pcr started to decrease after \u223c1 week but remained elevated throughout 1 month of follow-up. Results. From the maternal-fetal Pcr measurements it was quite evident that during the second half of gestation the small molecular weight creatinine (113 dalton, 0.3 nm radius) of the mother and fetus equilibrates at all maternal Pcr levels. The newborn Pcr levels were not only high at the time of birth but remained so for more than 3 weeks. It was also shown that the smaller the infant the higher the Pcr levels. The results of the animal experimental data showed that adult rabbits had the normal physiologic pattern in which Ccr overestimates Cin (Ccr/Cin ratio &gt;1.0). In contrast, the results in the newborn rabbits showed an unexpected underestimation of the Ccr vis-a\u0300-vis Cin (Ccr/Cin ratio &lt;1.0). This means, as is explained at length in the \u201cDiscussion\u201d of this article, that the preterm newborn infant reabsorbs creatinine along the renal tubule. Conclusion. The riddle of the high Pcr levels in term and particularly in preterm newborns seems to be solved. Once the umbilical cord is severed, the perfect intrauterine maternal-fetal biochemical balance is disturbed. Thereafter, the already transferred exogenous, adult-level creatinine will rapidly disappear in the first urine specimens passed by the now autonomous newborn infant. A new steady state is achieved in due time, based on independent neonatal factors. One of these factors is the unusual occurrence of tubular creatinine reabsorption. We hypothesize that this latter temporary phenomenon is attributable to back-flow of creatinine across leaky immature tubular and vascular structures. With time, maturational renal changes will impose a barrier to creatinine. From that point onwards, total body muscle mass, glomerular filtration rate, and tubular secretion will in health determine the Pcr level of the individual. plasma creatinine, tubular handling of creatinine, newborn, premature infants.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging\"]", "language": "de", "length": [74, 0, 0], "string": "title={MR-Elastografie - Steifigkeit der Leber als HCC-Risikofaktor identifiziert}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)\"]", "language": "en", "length": [97, 0, 0], "string": "title={K.

The aim of the present study was to identify topographical differences of TMEV spread and demyelination in the brain of experimentally infected susceptible SJL/J mice and resistant C57BL/6 mice. Methods: Demyelination was confirmed by Luxol fast blue and cresyl violet staining and axonal damage by neurofilament-specific and \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein-specific immunohistochemistry. Viral dissemination within the central nervous system (CNS) was quantified by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Further, the phenotype of infected cells was determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results: An early transient infection of periventricular cells followed by demyelination and axonopathies around the fourth ventricle in SJL/J mice was noticed. Periventricular and brain stem demyelination was associated with a predominant infection of microglia/macrophages and oligodendrocytes. Conclusions: Summarized, the demonstration of ependymal infection and subjacent spread into the brain parenchyma as well as regional virus clearance despite ongoing demyelination and axonal damage in other CNS compartments allows new insights into TME pathogenesis. This novel aspect of TMEV CNS interaction will enhance the understanding of region-specific susceptibilities to injury and regenerative capacities of the brain in this MS model.}",

Athletes}, container_title={}, abstract={Objectives: The spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in February and March of 2020 led to the delay or cancellation of major sporting leagues and events across the globe. Collegiate athletic competitions were postponed until the end of the 2020 calendar year and organized collegiate athletic practices and training camps throughout 2020 were either cancelled or significantly reduced in frequency. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on injury epidemiology in collegiate athletics has not yet been investigated. We aim to describe the types of athletic injuries sustained by high level collegiate athletes before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The Pacific 12 (Pac-12) Health Analytics Program contains all injuries sustained by intercollegiate athletes in the Pac-12 conference. This database was queried for injuries that occurred across all sports from January 2019 to June 2021. For all sports, timing of injury onset (acute versus overuse), severity of injury, rate of procedural intervention, injury mechanism (contact versus non-contact), and likelihood of injury during the 4th quarter of competition (final 25% of competition) was compared between the season immediately preceding the COVID-19 pandemic and the season immediately after. In this database, injury timing is defined as overuse if symptom onset occurred more than 24 hours after the precipitating incident. Results were stratified by upper and lower extremity as well as sport. Sub group analyses were also performed on knee and shoulder injuries among athletes competing in sports with historically high rates of knee and shoulder injuries. Multivariate analysis including gender was performed. Results: A total of 12,319 sport-related injuries across 23 sports were identified. The overall proportion of injuries sustained during the 4th quarter of competition was higher in the post-pandemic season (28.5% vs. 25.9%, p=0.015) and the overall proportion of non-contact injury was higher in the post-pandemic season (46.1% vs. 39.8%, pConclusions: Compared with the season immediately preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, athletes competing in the post-pandemic season were at higher risk of non-contact injury and injury near the end of a competition. There was a higher risk of overuse knee injuries and non-contact knee and shoulder injuries in the post-pandemic season. These findings are the first to describe the effect of a global pandemic on an athlete\u2019s injury risk profile upon return to sport and may be used to guide decisions regarding athlete workload and training.

Drug repositioning in oncology refers to the use of drugs formulated for other indications that showed antitumor potential. Los is an antagonist of angiotensin II receptor used to treat hypertension. We aim to study the combined effect of metronomic Cy+Los on M-234p tumor. Female BALB/c mice were orthotopically challenged with M-234p (day 0) and distributed, on day 8, into 4 groups (n=5-6/group) treated as follows, GI: Control, without treatment; GII: Cy 25mg/kg/day in the drinking water; GIII: Los 200mg/kg/day in the drinking water; GIV: Treated as GII+GIII. Mice were weighted, and tumor volume measured 3 times/week. When tumors were exponentially growing, mice were euthanized, tumors excised, and blood samples taken for immunohistochemistry, western blot and flow cytometry. GIV showed tumor growth inhibition compared to GI, GII and GIII and, as a consequence, higher survival (P&lt;0.005). Also, GIV showed 60% (3/5) of complete tumor regressions, without relapses. No weight losses or sings of toxicity were observed. IHC analysis showed a lower N\u00b0 of Ki67+ cells in GIV (P&lt;0.05). Moreover, a significant increase of apoptosis in GIV vs Control was shown by TUNEL assay (P&lt;0.05). No differences in circulating CD4+, CD8+ and Treg cells were shown by flow cytometry but, a marginally significant increase in Th17 cells in GII and GIV was seen. To share some light on the effect of the therapy on the cancer associated fibroblasts, the protein \u03b1SMA was measured by western blot; the expression of this marker was significantly lower in GIV vs GI (P&lt;0.05). To evaluate the anti-metastatic effect of the therapy, mice were inoculated i.v. with 5x105 M-234p cells. On day 3, mice were distributed in the same experimental groups. When the first mouse showed signs of metastatic disease, all of them were euthanized, lungs excised and stained to highlight metastasis. The N\u00b0 of lung metastasis was significantly lower in GII and GIV. No weight losses or any other sing of toxicity were observed. These results clearly show that metronomic chemotherapy with a combination of Cyclophosphamide and Losartan, administered as an intervention strategy, can inhibit, not only the growth of a triple negative mammary adenocarcinoma, causing permanent regressions, but also its metastasis, while being devoid of toxicity. Those effects would be achieved, at least partially, by inhibition of tumor proliferation, increase of apoptosis and modification of tumor microenvironment through tumor fibroblasts. The characteristics and the efficacy of the therapeutic schedule herein utilized suggest its implementation at the clinical setting in the near future. Citation Format: Julian Guercetti, Leandro E.

An emerging model indicates that non-OCSCs may dedifferentiate and acquire stem cell properties under certain circumstances. Recent studies in OC implicate a critical role for aberrant cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion and the IL-6 signaling pathway may play a critical role in converting non-CSCs to CSC. In the current study, we investigated the mechanism contributing to OCSC enrichment after platinum treatment in vivo. We hypothesize that platinum-induced IL-6 secretion activates STAT3 signaling-mediated expression of the cancer stem cell marker ALDH1A1, resulting in CSC enrichment. In addition, based on our previous study in OCSCs (Wang et al., 2014, Cancer Res.), we sought to examine the mechanism by which guadecitabine (SGI-110), a second generation hypomethylating agent HMA, inhibits OCSCs in OC xenograft residuals after platinum treatment. Methods: OC cells (OVCAR4 and A2780) were cultured alone or co-cultured with normal omental fibroblasts (NOFs) or guadecitabine (100nM, 3days)-treated NOFs in the starving condition for 24h and then treated with 3h cisplatin (CDDP; respective IC50 doses of 27.4 and 14.7\u03bcM), guadecitabine, IL-6 (100ng/ml), neutralizing antibody (Nab) against IL-6 (IL-6-Nab, 200ng/mL) or IL-6+IL-6-Nab. IL-6 secretion levels were measured by ELISA. FACS was used to analyze OCSC population marked as aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)+ cells, and western blot was used to examine ALDH1A1 and pSTAT3 levels in cells treated as described above. An ALDH1A1 promoter-luciferase reporter (pGL3-ALDH1A1-Luc; -1 to -1031) assay was used to determine whether IL-6 transactivates ALDH1A1 expression in OC cells. OC cell migration under the described conditions was determined by transwell migration assays. Results: We found that CDDP induced (P&lt;0.05) IL-6 secretion by OCs up to 48h post-treatment and up to 96h by NOFs or by co-cultured cells, suggesting a role of the tumor microenvironment in platinum-induced IL-6 secretion. Guadecitabine inhibited (P&lt;0.05) CDDP-induced IL-6 secretion by NOFs alone or in co-culture with OVCAR4, suggesting an inhibitory role of the HMA on IL-6 signaling. By assaying FACS sorted ALDH+/- cells, we determined that ALDH+ cells express increased (P&lt;0.05) levels of the IL-6 receptor and secrete higher (P&lt;0.05) levels of IL-6 in the conditioned media compared to ALDH- cells. Treatment of OC cells with IL-6 enriched the percentage of ALDH+, which was inhibited by IL-6-Nab. Luciferase assay results revealed that IL-6 transactivated (p&lt;0.05) ALDH1A1 reporter gene expression in ALDH- cells, which was blocked by IL-6-Nab. Further, we observed that IL-6- or CDDP-treated OC cells increased (P&lt;0.05) ALDH1A1 and pSTAT3 protein expression, and guadecitabine treatment inhibited (P&lt;0.05) expression of ALDH1A1 and pSTAT3 in OCs. ALDH+ cells showed greater migration potential than ALDH- cells, and guadecitabine inhibited (P&lt;0.05) migration of both ALDH+ and ALDH- cells. Guadecitabine, alone or combination with IL-6-Nab, inhibited (P&lt;0.05) CDDP-induced OVCAR4 migration in co-culture with NOFs. Conclusion: Our data indicate that IL-6 is a potent regulator of ALDH1A1 expression and the OCSC phenotype and further suggest an inhibitory effect of guadecitabine on the conversion of non-OCSCs to OCSCs. The data support a role for IL-6 in OCSC enrichment after platinum treatment and suggest that a combination approach of IL-6 neutralizing antibody with guadecitabine could represent a novel maintenance strategy after chemotherapy for eradicating OCSCs and preventing tumor recurrence.

Such methods invariably make the critical assumption of a single isolated population receiving no immigrants over the study interval. For most populations in the real world, however, migration is not negligible and can substantially bias estimates of Ne if it is not accounted for. Here we extend previous moment and maximum-likelihood methods to allow the joint estimation of Ne and migration rate (m) using genetic samples over space and time. It is shown that, compared to genetic drift acting alone, migration results in changes in allele frequency that are greater in the short term and smaller in the long term, leading to under- and overestimation of Ne, respectively, if it is ignored. Extensive simulations are run to evaluate the newly developed moment and likelihood methods, which yield generally satisfactory estimates of both Ne and m for populations with widely different effective sizes and migration rates and patterns, given a reasonably large sample size and number of markers.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Then the cationized cotton fabrics were treated with the prepared silver nanoparticles to improve their antibacterial properties. The untreated and treated cotton fabrics were dyed with two acid dyes Acid Brilliant Blue PB 100% (acid blue 25; AB25) and Acid Metanil Yellow MT 100% (acid yellow 36) at concentrations of 2%, 4%, and 6% of by exhaust method. Colour strength, color, and washing fastness of untreated and treated cotton fabrics were studied. Antibacterial properties of fabrics were also evaluated against S. aureus and E. coli by using the disk diffusion method. Dyeing properties showed that the treated cotton fabrics significantly improved color strength and fastness properties (light, washing, perspiration, and rubbing). Also, the antibacterial properties of treated cotton fabrics showed antibacterial activity towards tested bacteria. This study reveals that modified cotton fabrics via cationization with Quat-188 and AgNPs have multifunctional properties from their ability for acid dyes and their higher antibacterial activity towards Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria that is can be used in many applications.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Library and Information Sciences\", \"Literature and Literary Theory\", \"Linguistics and Language\", \"Language and Linguistics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [13, 0, 0], "string": "title={\"Malingering\"}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Metals and Alloys\", \"Mechanics of Materials\", \"Condensed Matter Physics\", \"Metals and Alloys\", \"Mechanics of Materials\", \"Condensed Matter Physics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [93, 0, 0], "string": "title={Interrelations of cooling rate, microstructure, and mechanical properties in four HSLA steels}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Electrical and Electronic Engineering\", \"Biochemistry\", \"Instrumentation\", \"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics\", \"Analytical Chemistry\"]", "language": "en", "length": [95, 0, 1028], "string": "title={A Vision-Driven Collaborative Robotic Grasping System Tele-Operated by Surface Electromyography}, container_title={}, abstract={This paper presents a system that combines computer vision and surface electromyography techniques to perform grasping tasks with a robotic hand. In order to achieve a reliable grasping action, the vision-driven system is used to compute pre-grasping poses of the robotic system based on the analysis of tridimensional object features. Then, the human operator can correct the pre-grasping pose of the robot using surface electromyographic signals from the forearm during wrist flexion and extension. Weak wrist flexions and extensions allow a fine adjustment of the robotic system to grasp the object and finally, when the operator considers that the grasping position is optimal, a strong flexion is performed to initiate the grasping of the object. The system has been tested with several subjects to check its performance showing a grasping accuracy of around 95% of the attempted grasps which increases in more than a 13% the grasping accuracy of previous experiments in which electromyographic control was not implemented.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Purpose: To evaluate whether a modified suture button Latarjet procedure can decrease the acromiohumeral distance (AHD). Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted among 155 patients who underwent a modified suture button Latarjet procedure between 2013 and 2015. AHD was measured on bilateral computed tomography scans taken preoperatively and on scans of the affected shoulder taken on postoperative day 1 and postoperative month (POM) 6, POM 36, and POM 60. At each time point, we recorded pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) and objective shoulder function using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, Rowe, and Walch-Duplay scores. Preoperative and final follow-up VAS and functional scores were compared using the paired t test. Pairwise comparison of AHD values at each follow-up time point were compared with the preoperative intact side using the paired t test. Intra- and interobserver reproducibility of the AHD measurements was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Results: A total of 104 patients who met the criteria completed the final follow-up, which occurred at 62.6 \u00b1 2.4 months (mean \u00b1 SD).

proposed an efficient node to node route discovery in Mobile AD HOC network based on neighboring nodes resent route discovery. MANET is always depends on selected and constant path with extended time period subsequently, and the flexibility of the battery power will be condensed in searching end nodes which roots numerous path failure. In most of the scenario path failure origins consistent route discovery which is normally reduces the efficiency and it will increase the dependency in computational overhead of the nodes in the mobile routing environment .In order to overcome such failure in MANET it is proposed to implementing route discovery methodologiesand it will be done through neighboring nodes with its resent history log which is an efficient factor to reduce delay between nodes and improve consistency comparing with existing system. DSR were experimentally implemented and compared to find the end to end delay, throughput and packet delivery ratio between nodes. The proposed work is focused towards effective node discovery through Proficient Route Encounter (PRE) algorithm which minimize the delay and energy resource of the path finding node, time taken to reach its requested node and maximize packet delivery ratio and its energy efficiency.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Astronomy and Astrophysics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [75, 0, 0], "string": "title={Electric-magnetic duality and the conditions of inflationary magnetogenesis}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Nuclear and High Energy Physics\"]", "language": "en", "length": [48, 0, 587], "string": "title={LOWER BOUNDS FOR THE ENERGY OF A MANY-BODY MODEL}, container_title={}, abstract={The well known and analytically solvable Lipkin\u2013Meshkov\u2013Glick model was devised to test several many-body approximation approaches used in nuclear physics.

challenges to increase production while maintaining welfare of livestock, efficiently use of resources, and being environmentally sustainable. To help overcome these challenges, remote and real-time monitoring of the environmental and biological conditions of the aquaculture site is highly important. Multiple remote monitoring solutions for investigating the growth of seaweed are available, but no integrated solution that monitors different biotic and abiotic factors exists. A new integrated multi-sensing system would reduce the cost and time required to deploy the system and provide useful information on the dynamic forces affecting the plants and the associated biomass of the harvest. In this work, we present the development of a novel miniature low-power NFC-enabled data acquisition system to monitor seaweed growth parameters in an aquaculture context. It logs temperature, light intensity, depth, and motion, and these data can be transmitted or downloaded to enable informed decision making for the seaweed farmers. The device is fully customisable and designed to be attached to seaweed or associated mooring lines. The developed system was characterised in laboratory settings to validate and calibrate the embedded sensors. It performs comparably to commercial environmental sensors, enabling the use of the device to be deployed in commercial and research settings.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Infectious Diseases\", \"Cell Biology\", \"Molecular Biology\", \"Immunology\", \"Microbiology\"]", "language": "en", "length": [162, 0, 1704], "string": "title={Aryl hydrocarbon receptor/IL-22/Stat3 signaling pathway is involved in the modulation of intestinal mucosa antimicrobial molecules by commensal microbiota in mice}, container_title={}, abstract={Compelling evidence demonstrates the crucial role of the commensal microbiota in host physiology and the detrimental effects of its perturbations following antibiotic treatment. However, the effects of commensal microbiota on intestinal mucosa antimicrobial molecules have not been elucidated systematically. Here, we investigate the impacts of antibiotic-induced depletion and subsequent restoration of the intestinal microbiota on the murine antimicrobial molecules in intestinal mucosa. Our results demonstrate that depletion of commensal microbiota leads to intestinal mucosa atrophy and reduction of antimicrobial molecules, including lysozyme, regenerating islet-derived protein 3 gamma (RegIII\u03b3), and cryptdin 5 mRNA, whereas subsequent reconstitution of intestinal microbiota by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) rescues mucosa morphology and antimicrobials. Importantly, our study shows that down-regulation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), interleukin-22 (IL-22), and phosphorylated Stat3 (p-Stat3) is associated with decreased antimicrobials, which might mediate the antibiotic-associated intestinal mucosa injury. Last, exogenous activation of the AhR/IL-22/Stat3 signaling pathway with the AhR agonist 6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (Ficz) rescued antimicrobial molecule levels markedly after antibiotic treatment to levels similar to those following reconstitution of intestinal microbiota by FMT. Together, our results demonstrate that the AhR/IL-22/Stat3 signaling pathway is involved in the modulation of intestinal mucosa antimicrobial molecules by commensal microbiota and suggest this pathway as a promising target in the treatment of antibiotic-associated gut barrier damage.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Computer Science Applications\"]", "language": "en", "length": [50, 0, 0], "string": "title={Optimal integrated design of biochemical processes}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Spectroscopy\", \"Instrumentation\"]", "language": "en", "length": [92, 0, 662], "string": "title={Fluorescence Lifetime Selectivity in Multifrequency Phase-Resolved Fluorescence Spectroscopy}, container_title={}, abstract={Theoretical aspects of the implementation of fluorescence lifetime selectivity in multifrequency phase-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy (PRFS) are discussed.

The results were broadly consistent with previously published data, with a few notable exceptions. Because of the production of ettringite, setting times were decreased. The maximal hydration temperature increased in concretes containing 40 wt% CSA but dropped in concretes with 20 wt% replacement. The drop was caused by a lack of accessible sulfates, which limited the synthesis of ettringite. In comparison to OPC concretes, the inclusion of additional anhydrite and calcium oxide was related with a delayed formation of the second temperature peak. Their excess slowed the calcium aluminate and belite reactions and reactivated the synthesis of ettringite, C\u2013S\u2013H, and portlandite.

The modification of lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is another biological function of histone in addition to modification of lysine acetylation (Kac), which may play a specific regulatory role in diseases. Objectives. This study compared the expression levels of Kcr and proteome between patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) combined with type II respiratory failure (RF) to study the relationship between Kcr, proteome, and COPD. Methods. We tested the Kcr and proteome of COPD combined with type II RF and normal control (NC) using croton acylation enrichment technology and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with high resolution. Results. We found that 32 sites of 23 proteins were upregulated and 914 sites of 295 proteins were downregulated. We performed Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), protein domain, and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis on crotonylated protein. In proteomics research, we found that 190 proteins were upregulated and 151 proteins were downregulated. Among them, 90 proteins were both modified by differentially expressed crotonylation sites and differentially expressed in COPD combined with type II RF and NC. Conclusion. Differentially expressed crotonylation sites may be involved in the development of COPD combined with type II RF. 90 proteins modified by crotonylation and differentially expressed in COPD combined with type II RF can be used as markers for the study of the molecular pathogenesis of COPD combined with type II RF.}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Computational Mathematics\", \"Computational Theory and Mathematics\", \"Modeling and Simulation\"]", "language": "en", "length": [14, 0, 0], "string": "title={Color symmetry}, container_title={}, abstract={}", "multi_hot_encoding": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"subject": "[\"Library and Information Sciences\"]", "language": "en", "length": [30, 19, 389], "string": "title={Free and Inexpensive Materials}, container_title={Collection Building}, abstract={There's no such thing as free materials, you scoff.

Materials and Methods: A total number of 16 kidney transplantations, were included in the present study. Thirteen patients out of them underwent a third kidney transplantation and 3 were fourth graft recipients. Data and variables on patient and graft survival were retrieved and analyzed using Kaplan-Meier statistics. Postoperative complications were assessed and graded based on Clavien-Dindo classification. Results: Patient survival was 92.3% after 1 year and 76.9% after 5 years (third graft). One year censored graft survival was 100% and a 5-year graft survival was 74.1% (third graft), respectively. In the cases of fourth transplantation, graft survivals of 33.3% at 1 and 2 years were noted among 3 patients. All fourth graft recipients have survived during our observation time. The overall rate of postoperative surgical complications among third graft recipients was 46.2 and 66.7% among patients after fourth transplantation.
